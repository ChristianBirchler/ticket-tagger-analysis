# Classifiers

## Introduction
This folder is home to two fasttext classifiers. Both are tested with a fasttext data set text file as input and generate a json containing the results of a 10-fold validation. The meaned results are in "results" and in "details" you can see the folds themselfes.

`classifier.py` is a stock classifier, the calculated Percision/Recall/F1 is generated by the `model.test()` function, which differs from the evaluation used in [ticket-tagger](https://github.com/rafaelkallis/ticket-tagger/tree/master/src). 

`ml_bin_classifier.py` on the other hand, uses a hand crafted multi-label-binary approach. It takes a **normal** fasttext data set as input and uses the [create_binary_datasets.py](create_binary_datasets.py) script to split it into 3 binary ones. During this process, temporary files are created and deleted. The structure of the output file is similar to the other classifier.

## Usage
 >Both classifiers use a fasttext text file data set as input and produce a json file with the results of the 10-fold validation.
