__label__bug "Add ability to use PIDs of existing objects Providing a full pid in the `-n` option will ingest an object with that PID; if an object with that PID already exists, the operation is skipped and logged. Problem/bug is, we can only provide a single PID in `-n`, and there could be many object input directories. So we need a way to get PIDs for every object in the input directory.    Work in #5 will let us get a PID from the FOXML, if it is present in the input directory (currently under development). Perhaps we can provide an option indicating that the object input directory encodes the pid. Of course, there are some characters that may exist in PIDs that you don't want in directory names, e.g., `:` on Windows), so they should be URL-encoded.        "

__label__bug "Issue triggering old pre-compiled synthdefs in v3.9 I tried to throw  `v3.9-beta1` into Sonic Pi but ran into an issue triggering the pre-compiled synthdefs. This behaviour can be reproduced with vanilla SuperCollider:    ```  s = Server.new  s.boot  //   s.sendMsg( '/d_loadDir', ""/Users/sam/Development/sonic-pi/etc/synthdefs/compiled/tmp/"" );   s.sendMsg(""/s_new"", ""sonic-pi-beep"", x = s.nextNodeID, 1, 1);  ```    Where the `tmp` directory contains a single synthdef:    https://github.com/samaaron/sonic-pi/blob/master/etc/synthdefs/compiled/sonic-pi-beep.scsyndef    EDIT (Brian): v1 file here: https://github.com/samaaron/sonic-pi/blob/36496b69e7e821562c6608a276b4536229d38250/etc/synthdefs/compiled/sonic-pi-beep.scsyndef    The behaviour I observe is that scsynth silently dies when attempting to trigger the synthdef.    This may be because support for the older synthdef byte code has been deprecated? Sonic Pi's synthdefs are compiled with Overtone, which hasn't yet been updated to support the latest byte code format.     If support for older synthdefs has been deprecated, it would be nice for SuperCollider to not silently die and instead print a warning explaining that the older byte code format has been deprecated - it should also probably listed as a breaking change in the release notes :-)        "

__label__bug "[4.0.0-beta.7] Reloading in deep component leads to reloading the whole state (root component) I have pretty big project with a lot of decorators. In v3 reloading in a deep and independent component leaded to reload only that component. Now if I reload `<Footer/>`, the whole `<App/>` will be reloaded as well.  My rough code structure:    ```  import {hot} from 'react-hot-loader';  import React from 'react';  import {render} from 'react-dom';  import {Provider, connect} from 'react-redux';  import {BrowserRouter, withRouter} from 'react-router-dom';  import App from './App';  import store from './App/store';  const HotApp = hot(module)(App);    const HotConnectedApp = () => (    <Provider store={store}>      <BrowserRouter>        <HotApp/>      </BrowserRouter>    </Provider>  );    render(    <HotConnectedApp/>,    document.getElementById('root'),  );    @withRouter  @connect(...)  class App extends Component {    state = {      initialFetchWasMade: false,    };      componentWillMount() {      this.makeInitialFetchAndOnlyThenShowContent();    }        makeInitialFetchAndOnlyThenShowContent = () => {      setTimeout(        () => this.setState(() => ({initialFetchWasMade: true})),        3000,      );    };        render() {      const {initialFetchWasMade} = this.state;      if (initialFetchWasMade) return <Spinner/>;      return (        <div>          <Header/>          <Footer/>        </div>      );    }  }  ```    Now, if I make a change in `<Footer/>`, the whole `<App/>` reloads and `makeInitialFetchAndOnlyThenShowContent` is called every time (and it takes pretty long time sometimes).   In v3 only `<Footer/>` was reloaded.    Is it a known bug? Should I create a repro?"
__label__bug MbTiles unit tests don't work with .NET Standard Unit testing of SQLite functionality has always been complicated by the dependency on native libraries. In the .NET framework solution of v1.0 this worked automatically. For the v2.0 .NET Standard solution this is broken again.     Perhaps turning the Test libs into .NET Core libraries might fix it.

While the specific modification (i.e. replacing it with cleaned `$ACT`) is not wrong per se, it unnecessarily breaks other plugins that are listening for their own `?do=` key, if that key includes uppercase letters.    suggested fix:  1) use early return before modifying any globals if this isn't the plugin's action  2) use only `$event->data`, not `$ACT`"

__label__bug "Sorting Configuration Wizard columns, entities, and value Not possible Note: @pgathogo You have not much to do here as the title suggests. :D @pgathogo and @gkahiu I know sorting and re-ordering of items in the wizard that are added in the db or written to configuration.stc might be a bit difficult or imppossible. However, it could be possible to sort items also reflect in the database and configuration.stc before they are created.   Currently, it is possible to change the order of items is by just editing them so that they are pushed to last in the list. As a default behavior it is good but this might not be desirable in some case. For instance, if a user has created 10 columns and wants the first one to be first_name. Then if he/she decides to make edits to first_name column after all columns are created, the first_name will be the last column. To make it the first column again, the user has to edit all others so that the first_name can be first in the list. This is a bit tedious.   Considering the time I have, I decide to add a drag and drop sort feature so it is used by the Configuration Wizard. I add it under [utils/util.py](https://github.com/gltn/stdm/blob/ref_config_mod/utils/util.py#L711) so that other modules can use it. In addition to the wizard, this feature can enhance other modules such as Document Generator and the Import Wizard. I have already incorporated the feature in Document Generator in t[his commit](https://github.com/gltn/stdm/commit/ab8499531c90ca1acd8298c210755f8e3f4a547b) but I didn't incorporate it to the Import Wizard considering the time. It can be incorporated in STDM 2.0.   I feel it would be great to incorporate the sort feature in the Configuration Wizard. You can implement it in the Entities creation page, the columns, and lookup values.   The method is tested on QTableView and QListView so you just need to do the following to add it in the wizard.   ```  from stdm.utils.util import enable_drag_sort  # In a code block where you target new profiles with no configuration and db enable_drag_sort(self.tbvColumns) enable_drag_sort(self.lvLookupValues) enable_drag_sort(self.pftableView) ``` "

Grub is booting.    ### Expected behavior :  When entering ""Install"", Xen should boot and Anaconda should start.    ### Actual behavior :  Nothing is happening when I enter ""Install"" (the screen goes black for less than 1 second and grub restarts).    ### General notes :  I tried to boot xen.efi directly, but it's not working (the laptop freezes at ""initrd.img"")."

__label__bug "Memory leak with MPI_Alloc_mem ## Background information  I have found what appears to be a memory leak within OpenMPI. This was seen in a CFD code we use in our research group, which uses the Boost MPI library. As part of its serialization of std::vectors, Boost makes use of MPI_Alloc_mem (balanced by MPI_Free_mem), and this appears to be the cause of a memory leak which eventually results in some of our simulations crashing due to lack of memory.    ### OpenMPI versions affected  v2.1.2 and v3.0.0 have the problem described below. v1.10.7 does not.    ### System and OpenMPI installation  Both the above versions were compiled from source  Platform: Ubuntu 16.04  Hardware: Intel 64-bit  Compiler: gcc-5.4.0 (default as on Ubuntu 16.04)  Configure flags:  ./configure --prefix=/local/data/public/pmblakely/openmpi-3.0.0-install    ## Minimal example  The short program below exhibits the problem:  ```c++  #include <mpi.h>    int main(void)  {    int i=0;    MPI_Init(&i, NULL);      char* result;    for(size_t i=0 ; i < 10000 ; i++)    {      MPI_Alloc_mem(100, MPI_INFO_NULL, &result);      MPI_Free_mem(result);    }    MPI_Finalize();  }  ```    ### Compilation  /local/data/public/pmblakely/openmpi-3.0.0-install/bin/mpicc  ./memory_leak_check_minimal.C -o ./memory_leak_check_minimal-3.0.0 -g  -O0  ### Testing  valgrind --tool=massif --threshold=0.1 --detailed-freq=1  ./memory_leak_check_minimal-3.0.0    Then, ms_print --threshold=0.1 ./massif.out shows:  ```  ->62.52% (1,615,768B) 0x59F6D75: opal_free_list_grow_st (in  /local/data/public/pmblakely/openmpi-3.0.0-install/lib/libopen-pal.so.40.0.0)  ```  near the beginning, and  ```  ->80.07% (4,312,304B) 0x59F6D75: opal_free_list_grow_st (in  /local/data/public/pmblakely/openmpi-3.0.0-install/lib/libopen-pal.so.40.0.0)  ```  near the end of the test-run (the final mentions of  opal_free_list_grow_st show that the memory is eventually freed, but  probably by MPI_Finalize()).    I have tested the same program against MPICH 3.2.1 and it doesn't have the memory leak."

__label__bug "Perform bool to uint8_t conversion at the notation level For @JasonGross, by way of a discussion with me and @andres-erbsen. Any mistakes in the transcription are mine.    The synthesized code works with one-bit integers a lot for carries and the like. This is nominally a `bool`, but C didn't get support for this until C99, so instead things got rounded up to `uint8_t` at some point down the line. This was done by way of making `TWord 3` a `uint8_t` while leaving `TWord 0` a `bool`, then somewhere telling the bounds-checker to round to `TWord 3` instead of `TWord 0`.    This has two problems. First, the unused `TWord 0` notations are not actually correct. Adding two `bool`s together is *not* addition mod 2. It is actually saturating. It's because C first casts the two `bool`s to `int`, adds them, and casts back down to `bool` by checking `2 != 0`.    Second, converting to `TWord 3` forces `AddWithCarry` and `SubWithBorrow` implementations to be pessimistic. They must take in a full 8 bits of precision in the carry bit and output 8 bits. This means one can't use the [real compiler intrinsics](https://software.intel.com/en-us/cpp-compiler-18.0-developer-guide-and-reference-addcarry-u32-addcarry-u64), which treat any non-zero input as a 1. Also, for instance, [this](https://boringssl.googlesource.com/boringssl/+/11850d5f618f2e39ad80fedb42feafa9047330b7/third_party/fiat/p256.c#65) `subborrow_u64` implementation isn't correct.    The effect is particularly pronounced for, say, `addcarryx_u26` and `subborrow_u26`. In theory, these could be implemented as:    ```  static uint8_t addcarryx_u26(uint8_t c, uint32_t a, uint32_t b, uint32_t *low) {    uint32_t x = a + b + c;    *low = x & ((1 << 26) - 1);    return (x >> 26) & 1;  }    static uint8_t subborrow_u26(uint8_t c, uint32_t a, uint32_t b, uint32_t *low) {    uint32_t x = a - b - c;    *low = x & ((1 << 26) - 1);    return x >> 31;  }  ```    These functions need only extract 26+1 = 27 bits of output, so a `uint32_t` is a sufficient temporary. However, if the `uint8_t` output is treated as a true `uint8_t`, rather than a stand-in for a `uint1_t`, we need 26+8 = 34 bits of output, and we must go up a word size, even though that's not actually necessary.    Proposal:    1. Fix the `TWord 0` notations to, rather than using `bool`, which doesn't work, use `uint8_t` with manual truncations. So, adding two bools would be `uint8_t c = (a + b)&1`. (Though I'd be surprised if you ever emitted that one.)    2. Remove the `TWord 0` to `TWord 3` conversion and leave all `TWord 0`s as-is.    3. Remove the `TWord 3` notation cases for `addcarryx` and `subborrow`. Only select those intrinsics when the carry bits are `TWord 0`.          "
__label__bug "Make `Streamers`' `iterate()` return a copy of the streamer As identified in #111, when activated, each `Streamer` generator maintains the state of the original object. This is a bug in situations such as `PoissonMux(mode='with_replacement')`, where the stream can be used multiple times. (See discussion in #111 for more details).    Proposals for fixing:  * Have the context manager make a copy of the streamer to activate, which is then used instead of `self` within the context.    Questions / Clarifications:  * Is returning a shallow copy sufficient?  * Option for deep copy? (i.e. `deep=True/False`)  * Maybe provide an option in `.iterate()` to set whether a copy happens or not, for the following case identified by @bmcfee:  > ...

__label__bug "Placed Flag isn't set any more # Problem Report  ## Describe the Issue  The placed-flag was working properly, until a special point in time. But now it doesn't any more.  Actual behaveour: the left column (References) gets colored from yellow over blue to green - this is as expected.  But the checkboxes all stay unchecked when processing the job.   When I do check them manually, they get saved and restored as expected,  when closing and reloading the job. Also the job processor skips that parts which were loaded with a checked placed-flag - again as expected.    What I am aware of what is different to before:  * I've merged Jason's patch regarding the affine transform for the board area  * added fiducials to the board (which I added manually to the board's parts list)  * marked several parts of the board to be ignored    ## Steps to Reproduce  How can a developer reproduce the issue you are experiencing? Use a step by step format like this:  1. Start OpenPnP  2. Load a job  3. Start the Job    ## Expected Result  The checkboxes should be checked one after the other (according to the green state of the referenc-column)    ## Actual Result  the checkboxes don't get checked    ## Notes, Log Files, Screen Captures, Videos, etc. to Show the Issue  If it helps, I could provide some additional files - please tell me.

__label__bug "Internal and Internet-Facing Aws-Load-Balancer-Scheme Cannot Coexist I just experienced an issue where the Ingress Controller doesn't create an internal/internet-facing ALB stack when the other type already exists.    **How to Reproduce**:  1. Create an ingress with the internet-facing ingress with ""zalando.org/aws-load-balancer-scheme: internal"" annotation.  2. Create another ingress for the same domain (not the same host) but with ""zalando.org/aws-load-balancer-scheme: internet-facing"" annotation (or without any annotations at all, internet-facing being the default).     **Expected**:   A new stack gets created as the first one cannot be used due to the fact that it's of a  different scheme.    **What Happens**:  The Ingress Controller doesn't create a new stack and reports the following in its logs:     ```  2017/12/21 20:55:53 Start polling sleep 30s  2017/12/21 20:56:23 Found 2 ingresses  2017/12/21 20:56:23 Found 1 stacks  2017/12/21 20:56:23 Have 1 models  2017/12/21 20:56:23 updated ingress not needed default/my-first-internal-app with DNS name ""internal-k8s-the-rest-of-aws-alb-name""  2017/12/21 20:56:23 updated ingress not needed default/my-internet-facing-app with DNS name ""internal-k8s-the-rest-of-aws-alb-name""  ```  Note that the ALB DNS is that of the original ALB created for the first ""internal"" app.    I'm using the latest image for the controller:  registry.opensource.zalan.do/teapot/kube-ingress-aws-controller:latest    Here're the Ingress manifests:     **Internal**:  ```yaml  apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1  kind: Ingress  metadata:    name: ""my-first-internal-app""    annotations:      zalando.org/aws-load-balancer-scheme: internal    namespace: default    labels:      app: ""my-first-internal-app""  spec:    rules:    - host: ""my-first-internal-app.mydomain.com""      http:        paths:        - backend:            serviceName: ""my-first-internal-app""            servicePort: 80  ```    **Internet-Facing**:  ```yaml  apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1  kind: Ingress  metadata:    name: ""my-internet-facing-app""    annotations:      zalando.org/aws-load-balancer-scheme: internet-facing    namespace: default    labels:      application: ""my-internet-facing-app""  spec:    rules:    - host: ""my-internet-facing-app.mydomain.com""      http:        paths:        - backend:            serviceName: ""my-internet-facing-app""            servicePort: 80  ```      I also tried omitting the annotation altogether for the seconds manifest.

__label__bug "bearer interceptor being created before keycloak.init Hello again,    I have just upgraded to 1.2.1, to get the new changes, hoping to fix the #4 issue, but now I'm facing a new one. This time I'm not sure where the problem is.    The `KeycloakBearerInterceptor` is constructed before my initialization code (`keycloak.init()`), where I define the `bearerExcludedUrls` option.    In the constructor we have this:    ```  var excludedUrls = this.keycloak.getBearerExcludedUrls();  this.excludedUrlsRegex = excludedUrls.map(function (urlPattern) { return new RegExp(urlPattern, 'gi'); });  ```    So the `excludedUrlsRegex` variable is set before my initialization function is called, and afterwards, during an intercept, the original, empty, `excludedUrlsRegex` is used.    Just to have something working, I have moved those two lines to the beginning of the intercept method, so it uses the latest `this.keycloak.getBearerExcludedUrls()`.    Now... I'm kinda new to Angular2+, so maybe I have done something wrong on my side. What do you think? Is it possible to make my initialization code run before the construction of the interceptor?      "

__label__bug "Filter Component keeps the simple search rule when deleting the search text ## Expected Behavior  When clearing the simple search filter's input, then the underlying filter should be removed.     ## Actual Behavior  When clearing the simple search filter's input, then the underlying filter remains in the internal memory structures and used for determining the filter's count presented to the user.  Even though an empty string filter doesn't affect the results (since `includes()` returns `true`) the filter object in held in memory and can even be stored as part of a view.    After using simple search and clearing the input, whenever you try to save the current view, the saved view will have a +1 filter count and contain an empty simple search filter.    ## Steps to Reproduce the Problem    1. Add a filter through the ""Add filter"" button - the filter count becomes 1  1. Fill the simple search filter's input - the filter count becomes 2  1.

__label__bug "Git log for a file is has all changes which involve submodules too  - [x] I was not able to find an [open](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues?q=is%3Aopen) or [closed](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues?q=is%3Aclosed) issue matching what I'm seeing    ### Setup     - Which version of Git for Windows are you using? Is it 32-bit or 64-bit?    ```  $ git --version --build-options  git version 2.13.0.windows.1  built from commit: eba7af3dbb4c846c6303c5f64102acee696c9ab0  sizeof-long: 4  machine: x86_64  ```     - Which version of Windows are you running? Vista, 7, 8, 10? Is it 32-bit or 64-bit?  Windows 10 FCU    ```  $ cmd.exe /c ver  Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.16299.64]  ```     - What options did you set as part of the installation? Or did you choose the     defaults?    ```  # One of the following:  > type ""C:\Program Files\Git\etc\install-options.txt""  $ cat /etc/install-options.txt  Path Option: CmdTools                SSH Option: OpenSSH                  CURL Option: OpenSSL                 CRLF Option: CRLFAlways              Bash Terminal Option: ConHost        Performance Tweaks FSCache: Enabled  Use Credential Manager: Enabled      Enable Symlinks: Enabled             ```     - Any other interesting things about your environment that might be related     to the issue you're seeing?    Using ConEmu.    ### Details     - Which terminal/shell are you running Git from? e.g Bash/CMD/PowerShell/other    Bash, CMD, Powershell, WSL Bash     - What commands did you run to trigger this issue? If you can provide a     [Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example](http://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve)     this will help us understand the issue.    I'm filing this issue from this stackoverflow question: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47185944/git-log-with-square-bracket-in-name    Reproduce it by:  * running this [shell-script](https://gist.github.com/kumarharsh/e1948c6971f1c68577792ff914a00af7) in WSL or git bash.  And then,    ```  1. Open powershell, type `git log .\[__Odd__].txt`  2. Open CMD, type `git log ./""[__Odd__].txt""`  3. Open WSL bash, type `git log ./\[__Odd__\].txt`  4. Still in WSL, type `git.exe log ./\[__Odd__\].txt`  ```       - What did you expect to occur after running these commands?    All git log outputs should have been the same.     - What actually happened instead?    The output of 1, 2, 4 is different from the output of 3. The output of 3 is correct (git log should not show changes for submodules while viewing git log for a particular file). Hence, it follows that git-for-windows' `git.exe` might have a bug.     - If the problem was occurring with a specific repository, can you provide the     URL to that repository to help us with testing?    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47185944/git-log-with-square-bracket-in-name  "

This is a bad approach. While we can introspect all Haskell values in a secondary thread without troubles, wlroots may free some C objects while we iterate them (e.g. output modes).    Libfuse can be integrated into our mainloop, with the `session_read_buffer` and `session_dispatch_buffer` (or similar, let me be lazy) but HFuse doesn't currently export those properly.  This approach would be better than the current hack.    When this is done, the mount/unmount should probably also be moved into a `Control.Exception.bracket` like construct, so it triggers deterministicly when we exit the compositor."

__label__bug "Tags for including Bootstrap4 I'm thinking of removing the template tags for inclusion of JS and CSS. When using local source/dist a dev should know what to include, may use webpack or another tool to combine static files, et cetera. So the only viable use case for including through tags would be CDN. This would burden us with keeping up with Bootstrap releases to adjust CDN URL's and signatures.    Any input on this matter?"

__label__bug "Component not accepted by Hot Loader if using react-refetch Hi! congrats on v3!  I have been trying to switch from `react-transform-hmr` to `react-hot-loader@3`and facing some issues. It looks like I can't get Hot Loader to properly works with components wrapped with https://github.com/heroku/react-refetch HOC (and since my parent App component is also wrapped, none on the children components are accepted)    ```  React Hot Loader: this component is not accepted by Hot Loader.   Please check is it extracted as a top level class, a function or a variable.

__label__bug "Database stores unchanged language strings I have a number of language issue which I have outlined numerous times the last #1789.     I am still having issues with saving changes to db and now to Merge File.      To nut this out, for now I am not concerned about main language files, I am only concerned with Plugin language files.    After installing plugin (any), I then wish to change language files.    I select Language from Main Menu and it loads the list of Languages installed then click on EDIT ICON for the Language I wish to change and loads the Languages Module.    I then select the plugin I wish to change and it CREATES a language file (language.xml) for the selected language in plugin_name/languages folder and loads Languages page for me to make EDITS.    I make the EDITS to the fields I only want EDITED (the Language String Name field background turns green and a Edit Icon appears next to String Textbox) and SAVE.  This always works the 1st time I do this for ANY Language and saves ALL (both unedited and edited) languages fields for the Plugin in db.    All good so far, although I cannot see the need to save UNEDITED fields.    Before going to another Language, lets Merge File firstly.    Here is issue.    I am confronted with 1 option - Write over original language file (language.xml).    If CHECKED it writes these to to language.xml in main /languages folder and NOT to languages.xml in plugin_name/languages folder?      If left UNCHECKED it CREATES a new file language-custom.xml in main languages folder.    Neither method Merges File to plugin_name/languages/languages.xml, but lets continue with the above.    Having Merged File, what is point of having these in DB? so I manually DELETE these from db as it should work from the Merged Files from above.    Having cleared both Language and Browser caches, I go to Store to see changes BUT none are shown.    So I ask a question?    Plugins Language files do not work from main languages.xml file, so why the the need to be Merged here when it does not work?  Also if I Delete plugin, it does not Remove these entries from languages.xml file.  So in effect Merging to here is pretty much pointless and useless.  Similarly with language-custom.xml, what is its purpose, when it also does nothing?     Merge File should merge to plugin_name/languages/languages.xml which works correctly when I manually move these here to test and not to languages folder as it currently does.      There is NO need for the current Option, although I would like to see Option (checkbox) to Delete DB entries after it merges file to modules/plugins/plugin_name/languages/languages.xml which was created earlier as outlined above.    Moving on, now I want to I want to change language fields for same plugin BUT for a different language.    I follow above method but select a different language and make same same changes as 1st language, it DOES NOT always SAVE these changes to db and if Merge File was working correctly as these have not been saved to db it will not merge edited language strings to file.    Got me baffled, although I do have a more appropriate f word I can use."

__label__bug "Combined mutation reader produces range tombstones which do not overlap with the query range in some cases Since: 1.4, but impacts cache reads only since 2.0    When we get two range tombstones with the same lower bound from different data sources (e.g. two sstable), which need to be combined into a single stream, e.g. when populating cache, they need to be de-overlapped, because each mutation fragment in the stream must have a different position. If we have range tombstones `[1, 10)` and `[1, 20)`, the result of that de-overlapping will be `[1, 10)` and `[10, 20]`. The problem is that if the stream corresponds to a clustering slice with upper bound greater than `1`, but lower than `10`, the second range tombstone would appear as being out of the query range. This is currently violating assumptions made by some consumers, like cache populator.    One effect of this may be that a reader will miss rows which are in the range `(1, 10)` (after the start of the first range tombstone, and before the start of the second range tombstone), if the second range tombstone happens to be the last fragment which was read for a discontinuous range in cache **and** we stopped reading at that point because of a full buffer **and** cache was evicted before we resumed reading, so we went to reading from the sstable reader again. There could be more cases in which this violation may resurface.    Possible solutions:    1) relax the assumption (in cache) that streams contain only relevant range tombstones, and only require that they contain at least all relevant tombstones    1) allow subseqent range tombstones in a stream to share the same starting position (position is weakly monotonic), then we don't need to de-overlap the tombstones in readers.      1) teach combining readers about query restrictions so that they can drop fragments which fall outside the range    1) force leaf readers to trim all range tombstones to query restrictions    I'm in favor of doing 2, because it would simplify combining readers, which wouldn't need to accumulate and trim range tombstones. That includes the cache reader.    I don't like solution 3, because it makes combining readers more complicated, slower, and harder to properly construct (currently combining readers don't need to know restrictions of the leaf streams).    Solution 4 is confined to implementations of leaf readers, but also has disadvantage of making those more complicated and slower.  "

We fist need to handle the special limits events in busboy here,  https://github.com/mscdex/busboy#busboy-special-events  and reject the promise if any of those are raised.  2. And the inner promise should reject if the mapFieldname does not match the fieldName,  ```  if (fieldName === mapFieldname) { // }  else { reject(new Error(`Field name mismatches ${fieldName} !== ${mapFieldname}`));  ```  3. I guess we should resolve the top level promise only on the busboy finish event.

For instance, the following works fine in GDScript:  ```swift  extends Node2D    export(int) var frame = 0 setget _set_frame  	  func _set_frame(f):  	frame = f  	var children = get_children()  	for c in children:  		if c is Sprite:  			c.set_frame(frame)  ```  But the same code in C# doesn't seem to work at all:  ```csharp  using Godot;  using System;    public class Armor : Node2D  {      private int frame;      [Export]      public int Frame {          get { return frame; }          set {              frame = value;              object[] children = GetChildren();              foreach (object c in children) {                  if (c is Sprite) {                      ((Sprite)c).Frame = frame;                  }              }          }      }  }  ```  When I try to do this, the following error arises: ```Failed setting track value 'Armor:Frame'. Check if property exists or the type of key is valid...```  In this particular case, I have a workaround, but I think that C# properties should absolutely be supported in AnimationPlayer.  "

__label__bug "Remote API's state name differences between input and output A few examples of differences:    When setting annotation document as ""COMPLETE"" via API's POST, it does set the user annotation to ""Finish"", but using API's GET to list annotations of the document, the state returns as ""FINISHED"".    The similar applies when setting it to ""IN-PROGRESS"" via POST. But API's GET returns data, which has annotation state of ""IN_PROGRESS"" with an underscore.    Is it reasonable to have consistency of these state names across API's POST and GET methods?"

When the complex list is in the first tab of the overlay the background does not collapse, but when the add/remove buttons cause an item to expand the list overflows outside the overlay background.    ## Reproduction steps  1) Add a new component which has a complex list in a tabbed overlay (complex dropdown in `sites`)  2) Select the complex list tab, the ""add items"" button is shown  3) Select ""add items"". The item is added, the overlay background briefly expands to contain it before collapsing down to the header height  4) Close the overlay. Reopen it, select the tab with the complex list.

Details: the issue was a poor clone()/copy() in the underlying jnum data structure. The problem affected all reduction modes but only for the first map generation. Since in 'deep' mode the map is generated only once, at the end, it was the most severe. In other reduction mode, the bug resulted in only slightly reduced quality...    Fixed for 2.41."

Using the macro inserted `UpdateTool`, not the chosen `UpdateToolBar`!  So I re-recorded the macro using `Ctrl+n`, the Vim auto completion, but the result was not better at all. With using the macro `UpdateTol` was inserted, instead of `UpdateToolBar`, because I mistyped the character `l` after hitting `Ctrl+n`, used `Back` to delete the mistyped character `l` letting VsVim auto complete to the correct text.

However, when I then check my phone, those messages are not sent, even though they appear in a correct conversation. If I pick a contact from the list in SMS App and send message this way, it is being sent correctly. The only difference is that when message arrives and I respond to it, it has a phone number prefixed with country code (+44 for UK). When I send it after picking a contact from the list, it only ha a 0 prefix. So I guess my phone app is picky when it comes to sending SMS to a number with country code prefix. If I add the country prefix with 00 instead of + (so 0044 instead of +44) it all works well. Is it possible to add feature that will convert + to 00? it would mean that I could have my conversation in a single window in SMS App."

__label__bug "ALL asset-delete buttons show ""delete this sprite?"" dialog ### Expected Behavior    When clicking on an ""X"" button, the message displayed is based on what is being deleted. For example:    * ""Are you sure you want to delete this sound?"" when deleting a sound  * ""Are you sure you want to delete this sprite?"" when deleting a sprite  * ""Are you sure you want to delete this costume?"" when deleting a costume  * (etc for backdrops and such)    ### Actual Behavior    The displayed prompt's message is always ""Are you sure you want to delete this sprite?"".    Though these dialogs are almost certainly temporary (i.e. they will be replaced by custom popup dialogs), the cause of the issue is still worth noting.    This problem stems from all asset [`Selector`s](https://github.com/LLK/scratch-gui/blob/64891259b1f58696208b20a46df917e58005a6b0/src/components/asset-panel/selector.jsx) using the [`SpriteSelectorItem`](https://github.com/LLK/scratch-gui/blob/64891259b1f58696208b20a46df917e58005a6b0/src/containers/sprite-selector-item.jsx#L23) class. It doesn't really make sense to have costume items using the sprite selector item; there should probably be a more generic parent class (ex. `SelectorItem`) that `SpriteSelectorItem`, and potential sound/costume-backdrop classes, inherit from.    ### Steps to Reproduce    1. View the ""sounds"" or ""costumes"" tab.  2. Click on the ""X"" button inside a sound or costume's icon.  3.

__label__bug Runtime crashes when trying to debug application with --start option When trying to debug application with the `--start` option the first debug session is OK. If I start the debugger again without restarting the application on the device - the runtime crashes.  After some investigation I found that this call -> https://github.com/NativeScript/ios-runtime/blob/master/src/debugging/TNSDebugging.h#L77 causes the crash. If I remove the error check the debugger will not start but the third time I start debugging with `--start` it works.    Steps to reproduce:  1. `tns create debug-test`  2. `cd debug-test`  3. Deploy the application and start it.  4. `tns debug ios --start --chrome`  5. Open the debug url.  6. After the Chrome DevTools are loaded and the application can be debugged - stop the debug command and close the DevTools tab. Don't restart the application on the device.  7. `tns debug ios --start --chrome`  8. Open the debug url.  9. The application crashes on the device.
__label__bug "A global ``.docutils`` smart_quotes setting overrides html_use_smartypants or extension setting Consider situation [mentioned](https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/3967#issuecomment-339408120) by @matthew-brett: user has a ``~/.docutils`` file which activates or deactivates smart_quotes.    Then this will override Sphinx's own setting either from (deprecated)  html_use_smartypants, or from an extension which would initiate a `smart_quotes` setting (cf ee52c7cd4f5e0a300c8fdd897c9529f5c633c7ed). This is bad because it is to be expected that a local setting overrides a global one.    Also, the setting in a `docutils.conf` file will override one set by an extension despite ee52c7cd.    Thus if we want to deactivate by default smart quotes for some builders (man, text, cf #4357), via a simple-minded usage of a `'smart_quotes'` setting as in ``environment/__init__.py`` this will fail is this issue is not fixed first.    One can test this by creating a ``$HOME/.doctutils`` file with    ```  [parsers]  	smart_quotes=no  ```    and use `html_use_smartypants = True` in `conf.py`. No smart quotes will be applied.    Or set ``smart_quotes=yes`` in Docutils user config file and `html_use_smartypants = False` in `conf.py` of local Sphinx project then smart quotes will be applied.    ### Environment info  - OS: Mac  - Python version: 3.6.4  - Sphinx version: 1.6.5, stable, master    Relates #4112"
__label__bug "inconsistency between the push and += operators with lists the `push` and `+=` operators work differently in corner cases involving lists; if there is an uninitialized lvalue declared as `list` or `softlist`, both operators implicitly initialize the lvalue as a list and then perform the list add operation.    In case the lvalue is `*list` or `*softlist`, the behavior is different:    ```  david@greybeard:~/src/qore/git/qore/build$ qore -ne '*list l; push l, 1; printf(""%y\n"", l);'  null  david@greybeard:~/src/qore/git/qore/build$ qore -ne '*list l; l += 1; printf(""%y\n"", l);'  unhandled QORE System exception thrown in TID 1 at 2018-01-06 07:51:38.848521 Sat +01:00 (CET) at <command-line>:1  RUNTIME-TYPE-ERROR: <lvalue> expects type '*list', but got type 'integer' instead  ```    There is also the case where the push command will perform changes in complex lvalue expressions without actually performing any push operation:  ```  david@greybeard:~/src/qore/git/qore/build$ qore -ne 'hash h;  push h.a, 1;  push h.a, 2;  printf(""%y\n"", h);  '  {a: null}  ```    My suggestion is to modify the `push` operator to throw an exception in other cases when no operation can be performed to align with the `+=` operator instead of silently failing.    another related example of `push` silently failing:  ```  qore -ne 'auto l = 1; push l, 2; printf(""%y\n"", l);'  1  ```    "

__label__bug "Use rappdirs for saving temporary files For [saving log files](https://github.com/jdblischak/workflowr/blob/7242a340986fa518b7f35e15de488d2853ea587d/R/wflow_build.R#L150) and creating temporary directories for unit tests, I  am using `/tmp`. The advantage of this approach over using `tempdir()` is that 1) the filepath is easier to read and type into a Terminal, and 2) it persists after the current R session ends. But of course the main downside is that `/tmp` doesn't really exist on Windows, and thus making the code work cross-platform is more difficult. From `?tempdir`:    ```  tempdir() # works on all platforms with a platform-dependent result  ```    To get this to work, I've had to write some [uncomfortably hacky code](https://github.com/jdblischak/workflowr/blob/7242a340986fa518b7f35e15de488d2853ea587d/tests/testthat/test-wflow_start.R#L26).    This has been on my to-do list to fix, but I recently found a bigger problem with this approach. When Joyce or I run workflowr on the same partition on Midway, the directory `/tmp/workflowr` is owned by one of us. Thus when `wflow_build()` tries to create the log files and `/tmp/workflowr` is owned by the other person, it fails.    My plan is to use [rappdirs](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rappdirs). It finds the path for saving temporary files for each operating system. I can save the log files in `user_log_dir()` and the temporary directories for unit testing in `user_data_dir()`. As an example on Midway:    ```  > library(""rappdirs"")  > user_cache_dir(appname = ""workflowr"")  [1] ""/home/jdblischak/.cache/workflowr""  > user_config_dir(appname = ""workflowr"")  [1] ""/home/jdblischak/.config/workflowr""  > user_data_dir(appname = ""workflowr"")  [1] ""/home/jdblischak/.local/share/workflowr""  > user_log_dir(appname = ""workflowr"")  [1] ""/home/jdblischak/.cache/workflowr/log""  ```    Note that I'll need to also need to specify the argument `appauthor = Sys.info()[""user""]`, which is used on Windows and safely ignored on Unix-alike systems."

__label__bug "Switzerland: Referendum to ban the trade unions Windows 7  Version: 0.5.4. master    The Swiss focus to hold a referendum over ""Banning the Trade Unions"" is pretty useless in it's current form. If it succeeds it gives you an event which decreases the popularity of Syndicalists, Totalists and Radical Socialists by 100 %. This does not change anything at all since both the syndicalists and the totalists will continue to gain party popularity until both of them reach 20 % or 40 % in total. That also means that the player won't be able to reach more than 60 % party popularity and therefore won't ever be able to achieve High Party Popularity when he decides to stay democratic or decides to go down the ""Enemies on all sides"" focus branch.    Furthermore it's weird that the syndicalists and the totalists would continue to gain party popularity even though their stronghold, the Romandie, has been taken by France.    - [no] Do you have this issue in vanilla?  - [no] Were you in multiplayer?  - [yes] Were you running other mods (music mod doesn't count)?

__label__bug "Login form detection does not work correctly on injected login page While looking for other examples for issue #42, I noticed that theverge.com is also behaving weirdly.  The login page there seems to be injected via JS after clicking the login button.    ## Expected Behavior  Username and password fields should behave like on all other sites.    ## Current Behavior  After clicking the login-button, the username and password fields are not recognized as such. There is no possibility to fill my credentials.  After switching to another tab and back to the theverge.com-tab, my credentials are listed in the KeePassXC Browser Plugin window in the navigation bar. When clicking the entry in the browser plugin, the credentials are filled and my username appears in the normal ""username selection field"" below the username field:  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5374166/33998987-7c60b730-e0e9-11e7-8292-4fd23d901d69.png)    When clicking the username, the login page closes unexpectedly.  When using the tab-button instead, I can see that the password field is also filled correctly.    ## Possible Solutions  This is probably very specific to how this login page on theverge.com is implemented.  The login page probably closes because the username-selection field is detected as ""outside"" of the login form. As a user, I feel compelled to click on my username again because the selection field hides the password field and I do not see that the password is already filled as well. Maybe the username selection field does not need to be shown when the credentials are filled from the extension-window.    ## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)  1. Create a password entry for https://www.theverge.com  2. Open theverge.com  3. Click the useraccount-icon or the ""Log In"" button  4. Notice that the username/password fields are not recognized  5. Switch to another tab and back again  6. Click the KeePassXC-browser-icon and choose the credential to fill the login form  7. Click the username below the username field (see screenshot above).    ## General Info  keepassxc-browser - 0.4.3    Operating system: Windows 10  Browser: Nightly  Proxy used: YES  "

However, if they try again and use the correct password and the right token immediately after, it works.    When the journalist makes a mistake entering the password and uses the right token, the message asks that they wait for the next token. And if they try with the right password and the right token it will issue exactly the same message because, not because of the wrong password but because the right token was used twice.    ## Steps to Reproduce    * Connect to the journalist login page  * Using an existing journalist account name  * Enter the wrong password and no token  * Try to login and see the error message asking to wait for the next token  * Do not wait for the next token  * Enter the right password and the current token    ## Expected Behavior    * Unable to login because the token is not the next token    ## Actual Behavior    * Login is successful     ## Comments    This is inconsistent and slightly confusing but I'm not sure this can be fixed.

Also worth testing the `inProgress` column of the `assettransformindex` table as it's likely an issue there.        ### Additional info    - Craft version: Craft 3 RC4  - PHP version: 7.0  - Database driver & version: PostgreSQL  - Plugins & versions: n/a  "
__label__bug "replacing a certificate cannot work correctly certificates and their related information are stored in two parts:  - a hashmap `fingerprint -> certificate` (and other info): https://github.com/sozu-proxy/sozu/blob/master/lib/src/network/tls.rs#L353  - a trie `domain name -> fingerprint` (to lookup the certificate from SNI usage): https://github.com/sozu-proxy/sozu/blob/master/lib/src/network/tls.rs#L351    Currently, if we remove the old certificate then add the new one, there's a gap during which TLS connections with those certificates won't work.  If we add the new certificate then remove the old one, then the adding part would replace the fingerprint in the trie with the new one, and the removing part would remove the new fingerprint from the trie (for all the domain names handled by the old certificate): https://github.com/sozu-proxy/sozu/blob/master/lib/src/network/tls.rs#L718-L720    proposal: store a `Vec<CertFingerprint>` as value in the trie. That way, when we add or remove, we edit the related vector. If we look up a name and the resulting vec has multiple entries, just take the first one, since it means the certificate is still valid."

__label__bug "Customer.email not added before used in squashed migration I've run into this while migrating from 0.8.0 to 1.0.0. It seems that the email field was added in https://github.com/dj-stripe/dj-stripe/commit/9f374b7b0c324d1f7844ae885191b6afeb97e57a but not added in the migrations before it attempts to use them. So, running migrations, I end up with this error when it attempts to resync customers within the migration process:    `django.db.utils.OperationalError: no such column: djstripe_customer.email`    When it's run on a fresh install it works since it doesn't seem to call the data until it's done, and it runs migrations that were left out of the squished one, which do add the missing fields:    ```  Applying djstripe.0001_squashed_0007_for_custom_subscriber_model...

It also allows you to target specific browsers so that Babel can do less work and you can ship native ES2015+ to user 😎 ! We are also in the process of releasing v7, so please give http://babeljs.io/blog/2017/09/12/planning-for-7.0 a read and help test it out in beta! Thanks so much for using Babel 🙏, please give us a follow on Twitter @babeljs for news on Babel, join slack.babeljs.io for discussion/development and help support the project at opencollective.com/babel  ```    So, we'll replace the former package, with the suggested [babel-preset-env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-preset-env) update."

This happens because obj is an array who has a property `propertyA` added to it after instantiation.    This bug doesn't affect `get` method. For this reason, and seeing `get` method logic, I propose  within this bugfixing, a refactoring of both `has` and `get` methods, maybe re-using logic from one function to the other."

There is more than one thread calling `BreakIterator.GetWordBoundaries` or `BreakIterator.GetBoundaries` at the same time.  4. Some particular strings are being used when calling `BreakIterator`.

""snapshots"" command works    ## What backend/server/service did you use to store the repository?  SFTP on remote Linux host, via plink because i want to use a key + a different SFTP port.    ## Expected behavior  find files    We discussed in the restic forum: I tried the find directly on the remote Linux server (because it is mine) with the local dir (so without SFTP) and there it works, just the pathes are not Windows like anymore.    Example:  ```  root@server /home/myuser/jail/data # restic --repo /home/myuser/jail/data/ find ""*.jpg""  password is correct  Found matching entries in snapshot xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx  /Wohnung/neu1.jpg  /Wohnung/neu2.jpg  /Wohnung/neu3.jpg  /Wohnung/neu4.jpg  /Wohnung/neu5.jpg  /Wohnung/neu6.jpg  ```      ## Actual behavior  got errors, see above.    ## Steps to reproduce the behavior  - create SFTP backend with pubkey authentication  - ""install"" restic on windows (=download the windows binary)  - download plink from the PuTTY project  - initialize a repo with the SFTP backend  - backup some snapshots  - try to find files    ## Do you have any idea what may have caused this?  Looks like it is something with the special plink-ish SFTP connection, because the find on the local dir on the remote server works.    ## Do you have an idea how to solve the issue?  No, i have no idea which permission to what could be denied.    ## Did restic help you or made you happy in any way?  Yes, a lot :)"

__label__bug "audit use of %% prefix operator in standard library e.g. https://github.com/zig-lang/zig/blob/5e6fc94b7f43dda028de779a874f12591fa0a50d/std/build.zig#L89    The `%%` prefix operator is supposed to mean that something is impossible, not that it's an error to happen. The above link is possible at runtime if the user passes in long `build_root` and `cache_root` parameters, and then the allocator runs out of memory while concatenating them. That's not impossible; that's an error.    I'm generally uneasy about `%%foo()` being easier to type than `%return foo()`. It seems that `%return foo()` should be more commonly used than `%%foo()`, so why is it harder to type? If the author isn't certain whether an error is possible or not, then use `%return` (or do more research and become certain). Only when the author is certain *despite the Zig type system* that an error is not possible is it appropriate to use the `%%` prefix operator.    Should we remove `%%foo()` and just let the user type `foo() %% unreachable` instead?"

One of these nodes is receiving input constantly, while the other does not. This results in nothing happening in the network, except the CheckTX function being broadcasted to the other node.     **What you expected to happen**:  I expected the input to be broadcasted to the other node, after which a block would be formed.    **How to reproduce it** (as minimally and precisely as possible):  See above.    **Anything else do we need to know**:  I'm not entirely sure if this is even a bug, it could just be expected behavior that I will need to deal with.

If you run `grep 'tre\.tretyp' *` in that directory you will see that there are zero other instances of this pattern. Most are of the form `(tp->tre.tretyp & COMMSK) == TCOM`. Some omit the `& COMMSK`. There are a couple instances of this expression: `tp->tre.tretyp != TLST`.    I'm opening this issue semi-rhetorically. It is obvious that the `==` should be `!=`. The only question is whether the value being tested should be masked with `& COMMSK`. And, for that matter, whether every other instance of an equality or inequality test of that form should be masking the value before doing the comparison."

__label__bug "Scope and Chapter admin pages return errors The scope and chapter admin pages are both returning 500 errors, likely because of changes to ActiveAdmin introduced in the last Gemfile upgrade.    The custom serializers from `arcdata_core` override `has_attribute?` on these models, and require the argument provided to that method to respond to `to_sym`. ActiveAdmin calls `has_attribute?` to check column types in the version we're using, but since it's calling it with a Proc (for actions) it fails on these admin pages.    The easiest way to fix this since the serializers have custom logic is to monkey patch the method in ActiveAdmin that calls `has_attribute?` and check that the argument it's receiving isn't a descendant of `Core::SerializedColumns` which has this behavior. About to submit a PR implementing this"

I found out the issue was caused by a project config option I am using - namely     `<CopyLocalLockFileAssemblies>true</CopyLocalLockFileAssemblies>`    When this is enabled `dotnet publish` puts ALL the nuget dependencies AND their dependencies into the release folder.    For reference the release folder with the option:    <img width=""1169"" alt=""sshot-2"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1750226/33858790-bd0d5be4-de96-11e7-98b1-dec2e1da9530.png"">    and without:    <img width=""1259"" alt=""sshot-3"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1750226/33858798-c24477c8-de96-11e7-9018-6e671f1a4feb.png"">    something `dotnet` is doing fails when using this option.  So the fix is to not use the option.    Personally I use it because when debugging I need all the packages from nuget in the build directory - which is a temporary workaround until better assembly scanning systems are in place in `structuremap`"

This is a breaking issue and it basically means we are not allowed to do actions in quick succession inside the update function.     The following code fixes the error on our side but it is not ideal and the Suas store should handle the action queue internally:     ```    override fun update(state: CurrentRoutingState) {          if (state.routingState is RoutingState.RouteToInbox) {              TaskFormActivity.start(this, (state.routingState as RoutingState.RouteToInbox).id)              Handler().postDelayed({ store.dispatch(DetailLoaded) }, 50)          }      }  ```    Expected behaviour :     No exception. The following code inside the SuasStore's dispatch() method should work better and perhaps add new actions to a queue `notifyListener(oldState, getState(), result.getUpdatedKeys()); isReducing.set(false);`     This is a breaking issue and we cannot continue using the library with this issue still in.

There's a proxy with the SSL cert that I had previously uploaded. Yay.  However, when I run `terraform plan`, it shows that the this resource is dirty and needs to be recreated:  ``` ~ google_compute_target_https_proxy.my-target-https-proxy     ssl_certificates.#: ""0"" => ""1""     ssl_certificates.0: """" => ""projects/my-staging/global/sslCertificates/app-myapp-com"" ```  This is very odd, as the target https proxy is still configured perfectly accordingly to my google cloud console. I'm not sure why terraform is refreshing my state incorrectly here. Is this a bug?  Thanks for the input! "

__label__bug "High memory usage on server after ~12 hours ## Description    After ~ 12 hours with a pycraft account connected to a server (1.12.1), memory usage on server is way more higher than official client or Minecraft Console Client (more than 2×): on my Ubuntu server with 16GB RAM, using htop, official client consumes 2.2%, MCC (Minecraft Console Client) consumes 3.0% and Pycraft consumes 7.1%. This seems to happen too with 1.11.2 server.    I'm using the latest version `46e058d`, zip-downloaded from GitHub. But I was able to reproduce with an older version, before 1.12.    ## Steps to reproduce    1. On a server, create a specific folder for Minecraft Server.  2. Download official server jar from Mojang: https://minecraft.net/fr-fr/download/server  3. Start a first time the server to generate eula.txt file.  4. Accept EULA.  5. Start again server, then run commands ""difficulty 0"" and ""gamerule doMobSpawning false"" to prevent mob generation (and random ram consumption).  6. Stop server.  7. (Optionnal) in server.properties, set online-mode to false to make tests easier.  8. Copy Minecraft Server folder twice: one for Pycraft client, one for MCC, one for official as reference.  9. In each directory, set a different listening port, and rename jar to readable name (for example, ""minecraft_server.1.12.1_pycraft.jar"")  10. Start each server  11. Connect at the same time one pycraft client, one MCC and one official client to its corresponding server.  12. Wait ~12 hours  13. Using any system tool, check memory usage for server: pycraft should use way more RAM than the others.    ## Expected results    Pycraft server should use almost the same quantity of ram than the other clients."

__label__bug "Should json-spirit be a required dependancy? ### Issue and Steps to Reproduce    The issue is that json-spirit is not considered a required dependency, but cmake build of the project fails if json-spirit cannot be found.    The issue can be reproduced by running `docker build .` on the following Dockerfile:    ```  FROM debian:sid    ARG DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive    RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential    RUN apt-get install -y cmake  RUN apt-get install -y python python-dev  RUN apt-get install -y libssl-dev  RUN apt-get install -y libboost-all-dev  RUN apt-get install -y protobuf-compiler python-protobuf libprotobuf-dev  RUN apt-get install -y python-sphinx  RUN apt-get install -y libcrypto++-dev libcrypto++  RUN apt-get install -y liblua5.1-0-dev  RUN apt-get install -y libgtest-dev  RUN apt-get install -y git vim wget    RUN git clone https://github.com/mickem/nscp.git    WORKDIR nscp    RUN git checkout 0.5.2.22    #RUN git submodule update --init ext/cryptopp  #RUN git submodule update --init ext/gtest  #RUN git submodule update --init ext/json-spirit  #RUN git submodule update --init ext/md-protobuf  #RUN git submodule update --init ext/tinyxml2  #RUN git submodule update --init ext/google-breakpad  RUN git submodule update --init ext/json-protobuf  #RUN git submodule update --init ext/lua-protobuf  RUN git submodule update --init ext/miniz     #RUN chmod u+x /nscp/ext/md-protobuf/protoc-gen-md    WORKDIR /nscp/build    RUN cmake ../    RUN make  ```    ### Expected Behaviour    I would expect either that the build should complete without json-spirit (possibly with some missing functionality) or that the message displayed during the ""Validating required dependencies"" step should report that not all required dependencies have been found.    ### Actual Behaviour    If cmake is unable to find json-spirit, it displays a message to say     ```  -- Found dependencies:  ...  --  ! Json Spirit not found: JSON_SPRIT_DIR=  ...  -- Validating required dependencies:  --  - All required dependecies[sic] found! (some modules and features migh[sic] stil[sic] be missing though)  ```    However, the build later fails with:  ```  [ 16%] Building CXX object service/CMakeFiles/nscp.dir/core_api.cpp.o  /nscp/service/core_api.cpp: In function 'void (* NSAPILoader(const char*))()':  /nscp/service/core_api.cpp:203:54: error: 'NSCAPIJson2Protobuf' was not declared in this scope     return reinterpret_cast<nscapi::core_api::FUNPTR>(&NSCAPIJson2Protobuf);                                                        ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  /nscp/service/core_api.cpp:205:54: error: 'NSCAPIProtobuf2Json' was not declared in this scope     return reinterpret_cast<nscapi::core_api::FUNPTR>(&NSCAPIProtobuf2Json);                                                        ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  /nscp/service/core_api.cpp: In function 'NSCAPI::errorReturn NSCAPIJson2protobuf(const char*, unsigned int, char**, unsigned int*)':  /nscp/service/core_api.cpp:331:17: error: 'hasFailed' is not a member of 'NSCAPI'    return NSCAPI::hasFailed;                   ^~~~~~~~~  /nscp/service/core_api.cpp:331:17: note: suggested alternatives:  In file included from /nscp/service/plugin_interface.hpp:3:0,                   from /nscp/service/master_plugin_list.hpp:22,                   from /nscp/service/plugin_manager.hpp:22,                   from /nscp/service/nsclient_core_interface.hpp:3,                   from /nscp/service/NSClient++.h:22,                   from /nscp/service/core_api.cpp:20:  /nscp/include/NSCAPI.h:36:13: note:   'NSCAPI::api_return_codes::hasFailed'     const int hasFailed = 0;               ^~~~~~~~~  /nscp/include/NSCAPI.h:41:13: note:   'NSCAPI::cmd_return_codes::hasFailed'     const int hasFailed = 0;               ^~~~~~~~~  /nscp/include/NSCAPI.h:66:13: note:   'NSCAPI::message::hasFailed'     const int hasFailed = 0;               ^~~~~~~~~  /nscp/service/core_api.cpp: In function 'NSCAPI::errorReturn NSCAPIProtobuf2Json(const char*, const char*, unsigned int, char**, unsigned int*)':  /nscp/service/core_api.cpp:335:17: error: 'hasFailed' is not a member of 'NSCAPI'    return NSCAPI::hasFailed;                   ^~~~~~~~~  /nscp/service/core_api.cpp:335:17: note: suggested alternatives:  In file included from /nscp/service/plugin_interface.hpp:3:0,                   from /nscp/service/master_plugin_list.hpp:22,                   from /nscp/service/plugin_manager.hpp:22,                   from /nscp/service/nsclient_core_interface.hpp:3,                   from /nscp/service/NSClient++.h:22,                   from /nscp/service/core_api.cpp:20:  /nscp/include/NSCAPI.h:36:13: note:   'NSCAPI::api_return_codes::hasFailed'     const int hasFailed = 0;               ^~~~~~~~~  /nscp/include/NSCAPI.h:41:13: note:   'NSCAPI::cmd_return_codes::hasFailed'     const int hasFailed = 0;               ^~~~~~~~~  /nscp/include/NSCAPI.h:66:13: note:   'NSCAPI::message::hasFailed'     const int hasFailed = 0;               ^~~~~~~~~  make[2]: *** [service/CMakeFiles/nscp.dir/core_api.cpp.o] Error 1  service/CMakeFiles/nscp.dir/build.make:86: recipe for target 'service/CMakeFiles/nscp.dir/core_api.cpp.o' failed  CMakeFiles/Makefile2:1047: recipe for target 'service/CMakeFiles/nscp.dir/all' failed  make[1]: *** [service/CMakeFiles/nscp.dir/all] Error 2  make: *** [all] Error 2  Makefile:162: recipe for target 'all' failed  The command '/bin/sh -c make' returned a non-zero code: 2  ```    ### Details    * NSClient++ version: 0.5.2.22  * OS and Version: Debian Sid (unstable)  "

This is the query that returns the torque results:    https://github.com/CartoDB/Windshaft/blob/master/lib/windshaft/renderers/torque/renderer.js#L106-L138    The query doesn't specified an order, so PostgreSQL is free to return the results in any order.    We can easily force the results in the order the text expects (by date):    ```diff  diff --git a/lib/windshaft/renderers/torque/renderer.js b/lib/windshaft/renderers/torque/renderer.js  index 10b502d..a9b98f6 100644  --- a/lib/windshaft/renderers/torque/renderer.js  +++ b/lib/windshaft/renderers/torque/renderer.js  @@ -133,7 +133,7 @@ Renderer.prototype = {                   ""FROM ({_sql}) i, par p "" +                   ""WHERE i.{gcol} && p.b_ext "" +                   stepFilter(attrs) +  -            ""GROUP BY xx, yy, d  "" +  +            ""GROUP BY xx, yy, d ORDER BY d desc"" +               "") cte, par  "" +               ""GROUP BY x__uint8, y__uint8; "";  ```    But this could affect the performance of the query.    On the other hand we're not relying on the data being ordered by date to render it on the client we could just change the test to not be order dependent and leave the query alone.    So we should check if wherever we use torque tiles we're assuming date order, or if the order doesn't affect our rendering.  "

__label__bug "Error running CLI on Linux when installed to ""$HOME/dotnet"" _From @mikeharder on January 5, 2018 21:4_  ## Summary  It seems the problem only repros when:     1. dotnet is installed at `$HOME/dotnet`  2. The command is run as `dotnet` which loads the file from `$PATH`  3. The command is run from `$HOME`, not any other directory    ## Steps to reproduce  1. Ubuntu 16.04 LTS  2. Install dotnet-sdk-2.1.3 using apt-get (https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/get-started/linuxubuntu)  3. `mkdir ~/dotnet`  4. `cd ~/dotnet`  5. `wget https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net/dotnet/Sdk/2.2.0-preview1-007840/dotnet-sdk-2.2.0-preview1-007840-linux-x64.tar.gz`  6. `tar -zxvf dotnet-sdk-2.2.0-preview1-007840-linux-x64.tar.gz`  7. `cd ~`  8. `nano .profile`  A. Add “$HOME/dotnet” to front of path  9. `source .profile`  10. `which dotnet`  A. Verify the path is `/home/username/dotnet/dotnet`  11. `dotnet -?`  A. Expected: Shows help  B. Actual: `Did you mean to run dotnet SDK commands? Please install dotnet SDK from: http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=798306&clcid=0x409`  12. `~/dotnet/dotnet -?`  A. Works fine  13. `mkdir foo`  14. `cd foo`  15. `dotnet -?`  A. Works fine  16. `mv ~/dotnet ~/dotnet-foo`  17. `nano .profile`  A. Change `$HOME/dotnet` to `$HOME/dotnet-foo`  18. `source .profile`  19. `which dotnet`  A. Verify the path is `/home/username/dotnet-foo/dotnet`  20. `dotnet -?`  A. Works fine    _Copied from original issue: dotnet/cli#8337_"

__label__bug "Deadlock in uncaught exception handling  I'm getting a deadlock from Rollbar when 2 exceptions are thrown form 2 different threads (a scheduler thread and the main thread). as you can see from the jstack dump, RollbarThread is waiting on the condition but the main thread is already trying to join it.  Note: the deadlock happens on startup (but after the library has been initialized) so it's possible that's it's a race condition with your init flow. (perhaps the interupt is sent to the RollbarThread before it actually starts and thus is lost?).  [traces.txt](https://github.com/rollbar/rollbar-android/files/258120/traces.txt) "
__label__bug "Lazily creating publish connection causes some weird behavior As brought up in [Discourse](https://discuss.particular.net/t/rabbitmq-transport-brokerunreachableexception/272), the behavior around opening the publish connection means that we don't try to open the connection until the first send attempt, which overall seems like a decent optimization. If an endpoint doesn't need to send messages, then we don't open up an unused connection.    However, this does have a couple drawbacks:    - For a send-only endpoint, that means we start the endpoint without actually opening a connection to the broker at all. Any problem with the connection string or connectivity to the broker won't be discovered until the first attempt to send a message.  - [We initialize the connection lazily using `Lazy<T>`](https://github.com/Particular/NServiceBus.RabbitMQ/blob/develop/src/NServiceBus.Transport.RabbitMQ/Connection/ChannelProvider.cs#L11), so if the single attempt to open the connection throws an exception, that exception is cached and we can never open a publish connection for the lifetime of the endpoint.

__label__bug "Acunetix - Cross site scripting (content-sniffing) | **Target URL** | http://221.179.130.109/newsList| ------------ | ------------- | **Severity**   | Medium|  ##### Vulnerability Description This script is possibly vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.    Cross site scripting (also referred to as XSS) is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to send malicious code (usually in the form of Javascript) to another user.  Because a browser cannot know if the script should be trusted or not, it will execute the script in the user context allowing the attacker to access any cookies or session tokens retained by the browser.  ##### Attack Details {&quot;input_type&quot;:&quot;URL encoded GET&quot;,&quot;input_name&quot;:&quot;uid&quot;,&quot;test_value&quot;:&quot;1'\&quot;()&%&lt;acx&gt;&lt;ScRiPt &gt;WQmH(9017)&lt;/ScRiPt&gt;&quot;,&quot;extra_details&quot;:false,&quot;repro&quot;:&quot;This type of XSS can only be triggered on (and affects) content sniffing browsers.&quot;,&quot;reflection_point&quot;:false}  ##### HTTP Request 	GET /api/get_user?loc=&uid=1'""()%26%25<acx><ScRiPt%20>AJhD(9200)</ScRiPt> HTTP/1.1  	Referer: http://221.179.130.109/newsList  	Host: 221.179.130.109  	Connection: Keep-alive  	Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate  	User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.21 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/41.0.2228.0 Safari/537.21  	Accept: */*  	  	  ##### Impact Malicious users may inject JavaScript, VBScript, ActiveX, HTML or Flash into a vulnerable application to fool a user in order to gather data from them.  An attacker can steal the session cookie and take over the account, impersonating the user.

__label__bug "Custom TableNameResolver have argument Optional.class instead of Entity.class Hi. I have problem when deleting an entity using deleteById.  I have table name resolver like below that is used to get table name for entity that code is working on     ```java  public class TableNameResolverImpl implements DynamoDBMapperConfig.TableNameResolver {        private static final String PREFIX_1 = ""X"";      private static final String PREFIX_2 = ""Y"";      private static final String PREFIX_3 = ""Z"";      private String environment;        public TableNameResolverImpl(final String environment) {          this.environment = environment;      }        @Override      public String getTableName(final Class<?> aClass, final DynamoDBMapperConfig dynamoDBMapperConfig) {          return Joiner.on(""-"").join(PREFIX_1, PREFIX_2, PREFIX_3, aClass.getAnnotation(DynamoDBTable.class).tableName(),                  environment)                  .toUpperCase();      }  }    ```    The problem is that with newer versions of library, findById function return now `Optional<T>` instead of `Entity` or `null`.  And in code when in FindById function instead passing an entity to function `delete(Entity T)` right now is passed `delete(Optional<Entity> T)`.   Therefore tableNameResolver instead of getting table name     ```  X-Y-Z-EntityClassTableName-environment  ```    It throws `NullPointerException`  Basically argument  `final Class<?> aClass` instead having value of Entity.class, it have value of `Optional`.class and it throws NullPointerException because of no annotation DynamoDBTable in class `Optional`.  One of solution that i found for this is small change in `SimpleDynamoDBCrudRepository` to passing Entity without wrapping it in Optional.

__label__bug "Refits do not correctly handle equipment changing location The attached files show...  Refitting a Highlander HGN-733 to a Highlander HGN-733P    If you view the MML equipment locations, please note the location of the SRM Ammo and LRM ammo in the LT.    Refit2.cpnx shows the finished 733P needing LRM ammo.    If the above unit deploys after having LRM ammo loaded it will deploy with 5 x LRM ammo and 2 x SRM ammo.    Recommendation: Refit calculations are working correctly in determining what changes need to be made. The resulting unit however assumes all slots are in the same position. Saving the Quality state of each part and then deleting the entire unit and parts, followed by generating a new unit and restoring Quality is probably a better approach.

__label__bug "String property with name ""url"" produces incorrect code ```  {      ""url"": ""abc""  }  ```    The generated `struct` has an implicit initializer `init(url: String)`, but we generate an extension with an initializer `init?(url: String)`.    The easiest way to avoid this is to just disallow `url` for property names.  I'm baffled that not a single one of our test cases has such a property."

__label__bug "navbar item only icon Hi,    And this is an alternative without a label:    ```    * [[:start|{{fa>home}}]]  ~~NOCACHE~~    ```      Three bugs I recognized.    1. If you use ""showHomePageLink""    and do not have home-button in :navbar    the font-sizes differ, items from tpl_navbar.php are smaller      OK, but I would agree it´s the better way to disable ""showHomePageLink"" because it´s more clearly if you have all items in one place (:navbar), but here ist a second bug, if you do not label the item (just icon) and if the item is selected in menu, it is not presented as selected (with special background).        And the third bug is: (this is not depending on bug 2)    If you choose another item in sidebar, the selected state of navebar item gets lost, allthough the new choosen item in sidebar is in the same navbar-menu.        Last but not least: this is a great work! Thanks  "
__label__bug "External app opens if external diff tool is defined in .gitconfig ### Description    Atom opens the external application for git diff, if defined in repository `.git/config` or global `.gitconfig`. In my opinion it should always use the built-in viewer editor. Reason I have an external tool configured is because when using command line I prefer to view diff using [Meld](http://meldmerge.org/). There's no reason to do it if already on a GUI (i.e. Atom).    This is possible in command-line using `git diff --no-ext-diff`, but I don't know how Atom handles it, if it's possible to skip git configuration from it.    ### Steps to Reproduce    1. [Configure an external diff tool](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/255202/how-do-i-view-git-diff-output-with-a-visual-diff-program) in `~/.gitconfig` or `.git/config`  2. Open a git repo in Atom  3. Change something  4. Click a file in the *Unstaged changes* panel  5. The external diff tool will be opened    If you want to reproduce **more quickly** without the hassle of configuring an external tool, you can specify any invalid command as diff tool. The command will fail, but Atom will not show the diff anyway. Just replace step one with:    1. `echo -e ""\n[diff]\n\texternal = missingno"" >> ~/.gitconfig`    ### Versions       Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS        Atom    : 1.18.0      Electron: 1.3.15      Chrome  : 52.0.2743.82      Node    : 6.5.0        apm  1.18.1      npm  3.10.10      node 6.9.5 x64      python 2.7.12      git 2.7.4  "

In the step 4, while getting out-of-scope locations[1], we have the bp position [2] and the location of `app.TodoModel.prototype.toggleAll` [3] and the location of the function arg for `this.todos.map` [4] (See [5] for the `toggleAll` method).    The location [4] now is considered out-of-scope by `containsPosition` because it doesn't contains the [2] position. This is correct from the view point of location-position relationship. As a result the Line 46 was totally ruled as out-of-scope.    The fix probably should be improve `getOutOfScopeLocations` function in handling this tricky scope thing such as concat comment locations, handling overlapping-inner location before calling `containsPosition` to do its job. (`containsPosition` did the right job and should keep focusing on location-position relationship)    [1] https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html/blob/c5177581a8af4b797f9aa56f82214216de0176c6/src/workers/parser/getOutOfScopeLocations.js#L86    [2] Object { sourceId: ""server1.conn173.child2/source34"", line: 50 }    [3]  ```  { // the location of `app.TodoModel.prototype.toggleAll`     end: Object { line: 51, column: 2 }    start: Object { line: 41, column: 37 }  }  ```  [4]   ```  { // the location of the function arg for `this.todos.map`.

__label__bug "Data update problem There appears to be a bug where a molecular data file will fail to update if a later calculation is done on the same molecule with an increased number of calculations.  For example, running:    ```  from openfermion.hamiltonians import MolecularData  from openfermionpsi4 import run_psi4    geometry = [[""H"", [0, 0, 0]],              [""H"", [0, 0, 0.74]]]  basis = ""sto-3g""  multiplicity = 1  charge = 0  h2_molecule = MolecularData(geometry, basis, multiplicity, charge)  h2_molecule = run_psi4(h2_molecule,                         run_mp2=True,                         run_cisd=True,                         run_ccsd=True,                         run_fci=True)    ```  Will produce the correct result.  However, if one precedes the Psi4 computation by a less detailed calculation, i.e.    ```  h2_molecule = run_psi4(h2_molecule)  h2_molecule = run_psi4(h2_molecule,                         run_mp2=True,                         run_cisd=True,                         run_ccsd=True,                         run_fci=True)  ```    The data structure will fail to update with only some of the new data, specifically the energies.  That is, things like the RDMs will populate but the cisd_ and fci_energies will remain as None.  This appears to be an issued with the plugin rather than MolecularData generally, as this issue doesn't persist with the PySCF plugin.  Moreover, running PySCF plugin with updated data, WILL update the incomplete molecule as intended, but this plugin will not."

134  ```    To me, this looks like a bug in Roslyn. But I wasn't able to create a repro using just Roslyn, so I'm reporting it here first.    The top of the stack trace looks similar to https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/7922, where it was noted (https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/7922#issuecomment-171713400) that:    > This occurs typically when an OOM occurs within ConditionalWeakTable while it's creating buckets, or setting up state, basically corrupting the integrity of the collection.    Though the very short code on input shouldn't cause any OOMs, so I still think it's a bug."

__label__bug "TargetCoverageSexGenotyper fails for bad samples The TargetCoverageSexGenotyper can sometimes fail to calculate genotype LLs for low-quality (low-coverage) samples. The exception below can be reproduced trivially: just pass it a raw coverage matrix containing a single sample that has all only zeroes in its counts column. In practice, I've recently encountered several samples that somehow passed upstream QC but failed to genotype due to extensive dropout. This causes program termination and no genotypes are written for any samples in the input. Could we instead warn and print an `NA` genotype for such samples?    ```[August 14, 2017 5:06:20 PM EDT] org.broadinstitute.hellbender.tools.exome.sexgenotyper.TargetCoverageSexGenotyper done.

__label__bug "Use Job status returned from execute method Reading the documentation on Job Status Codes (https://github.com/juriansluiman/SlmQueue/blob/master/docs/3.Jobs.md#job-status-codes) it indicates that Jobs can return a status code. However from reading through the worker code it would seem like a return value from the Job is never evaluated? See https://github.com/juriansluiman/SlmQueueSqs/blob/master/src/SlmQueueSqs/Worker/SqsWorker.php#L31 - (same for the other workers).  Two confusing point in the documentation are: 1. ""If any exception is thrown, the status is set to failure.""    It would seem that if the job throws any exception the status code is set to recoverable. Is it possible to indicate a fatal job failure? eg https://github.com/juriansluiman/SlmQueueBeanstalkd/blob/master/src/SlmQueueBeanstalkd/Worker/BeanstalkdWorker.php#L37 2. ""...you can return a non-NULL value from the Job's execute() method""    Like I discussed above - it would appear that the returned codes are ignored?  Maybe I'm missing something?

When you first create a device and receive its X-Coins-Api-Token from the server response, you need to save that device's <code>phone</code> number and <code>deviceCode</code> locally so that you can use it for authentication via /api/v1/auth in the future.    * Problem: A new device is created for every Hold that is created.  * Solution: Only create the device once, save the deviceCode locally, and use that to authenticate the device for future orders.  * Benefit: We can better track the user's device installations."

This essentially means I can't use particles unless I add a script to every particle object that removes the shader material when it exits the tree, which is just annoying.

__label__bug "Business network hash in runtime changes for every deployment <!--- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above -->    ## Context  <!--- Provide a more detailed introduction to the issue itself, and why you consider it to be a bug -->  When a business network archive (BNA) is deployed to a Fabric network, the BNA is hashed and then stored in the world state. The Composer runtime (chaincode) stores a cache of 8x BNAs, with the hash as the key, to allow the loaded BNA to be quickly retrieved without having to re-parse it for every transaction.    In a multi-channel environment, where the same BNA is deployed to multiple channels, each channel has a separate world state but each peer uses the same running chaincode process. This means that each BNA has space for 8x BNAs, no matter how many channels that BNA is deployed to.    The deployment code has a bug which means that when deploying the same BNA multiple times (to multiple channels for example), the BNA content is the same but the BNA hash is always different.     This means that for BNAs deployed to >8 channels (_n_), the BNA cache is having to juggle _n_ ""different"" copies of the BNA due to the different hashes. The BNAs are all the same and there is no reason to keep different copies. This results in behaviour where the chaincode has to regularly evict BNAs from the cache for no good reason and re-parse them on the next request.    For large BNAs, this results in significant delays and pauses as the BNAs are re-parsed.    ## Expected Behavior  <!--- Tell us what should happen -->  Hashes should be the same for the same BNA deployed to multiple channels, and the BNA cache should only contain one copy of the same BNA.    ## Actual Behavior  <!--- Tell us what happens instead -->  BNA cache contains multiple copies of the same BNA.    ## Possible Fix  <!--- Not obligatory, but suggest a fix or reason for the bug -->  Problem is timestamp based; during deployment we call `BusinessNetworkDefinition.toArchive` which results in new, current timestamps being added to the serialized BNA (which is a ZIP file).    ## Steps to Reproduce  <!--- Provide a link to a live example, or an unambiguous set of steps to -->  <!--- reproduce this bug include code to reproduce, if relevant -->  1.  2.  3.  4.    ## Existing issues  <!-- Have you searched for any existing issues or are their any similar issues that you've found? -->  - [ ] [Stack Overflow issues](http://stackoverflow.com/tags/hyperledger-composer)  - [ ] [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/hyperledger/composer/issues)  - [ ] [Rocket Chat history](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/composer)    <!-- please include any links to issues here -->    ## Context  <!--- How has this bug affected you?

__label__bug "re/im in Complex are not really replaceable **Reported by choeger on 22 Feb 2016 13:38 UTC** Although I do not know the motivation for making these fields replaceable, they are clearly intended to be redeclared at some point. The operator functions however make this pretty much impossible, as they import the record `Complex` from the **toplevel**.   See e.g. https://trac.modelica.org/Modelica/browser/Modelica/trunk/Complex.mo#L45  These import statements seem to serve no other purpose than to explicitly avoid redeclarations of re/im, so one of the two is redundant and confusing.  ----  Migrated-From: https://trac.modelica.org/Modelica/ticket/1918"

The issue is that for the context of the commands in the explorer we are seting the resource as the first argument and the [`IExplorerContext`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/workbench/parts/files/electron-browser/fileActions.ts#L61) as the second. This contains the `EditorInput` which can not be serialized to JSON.  We should only send the first argument over to extension the resource. @jrieken Do you think it makes sense to limit sending only the first argument to extensions, and if yes could you give me a pointer?

This was found to be an issue for injected sidecar containers, not for StatefulSets where the args need to be set by the user.    **Code ref**:  https://github.com/appscode/stash/blob/afa4f8fa82009f53295e0f3551010284e57aa4c5/pkg/cmds/backup.go#L24-L31  https://github.com/appscode/stash/blob/6f10418a9f1389814157ee141fa2fd8a0a9ad46a/pkg/util/kubernetes.go#L221-L227  https://github.com/appscode/stash/blob/6f10418a9f1389814157ee141fa2fd8a0a9ad46a/pkg/util/kubernetes.go#L199-L203    "

__label__bug "Violation of compareTo Invariants in TemplateFactory Causes Template Compilation Failures When trying to compile templates using ph-stx, it is possible to cause Java's TimSort implementation to throw IllegalArgumentException whilst trying to sort an Array of TemplateFactory instances. The root cause of this bug is that TemplateFactory's compareTo method falsely reports equality between signed zeroes of different types of NaN and !NaN.     Since ph-stx's functionality is dependent on the current implementation of compareTo, I have submitted a PR to use a custom quicksort implementation to work around the issue. I will submit a reproduction case and regression test in due course, but as the code that causes the issue is private this will require some work. The proposed fix is available for you to glance over in the meantime."

__label__bug "Unable to launch exported iOS app via XCode - Godot 3.0 Beta 2 **Godot version:**  Godot 3.0 Beta 2      **OS/device including version:**  macOS 10.13  iOS 11.1  Xcode 9.2 (9C40b)      **Issue description:**  I created a bare-bone Godot project with just GDScript to show Sprite node, no related to GDNative or anything else. My goal is to run iOS build on iOS device.    As there is no Xcode project template for Godot 3.0 Beta 2, I use such template from 2.1 with 3.0 beta 2's export template for ios binaries (debug/release), and my godot project's exported `.pck` file. Then run project via Xcode, as a result I got the following error    ![screen shot 2017-12-31 at 6 36 31 am](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/673757/34457830-a6ad80b0-edf8-11e7-89a9-f7f13d6dd026.png)      [1]: https://i.imgur.com/ZKyqdlJ.png      **Steps to reproduce:**  - Download export template from Godot 3.0 beta 2 official   - Extract zip, inside extract iphone.zip, then you will get 3 files which are `data.pck`, library fat for debug, and another for release (both are static library).   - Use Xcode project template as used in 2.1. Replace `godot_debug.iphone` with our library fat for debug, and `godot_opt.iphone` with our library fat for release one. Rename it to be exactly the same. Note that I consider this case to be the same step as done in 2.1 because both set of binary files are in fact static library. If this is wrong, please advice.   - Export Godot project into `.pck` file, then replace this result file with `data.pck` as seen inside Xcode template project.   - Open Xcode project and Run.   - Got the same result as shown on image above    As I see both two sets of binary files (Godot 2.1 XCode project template, and Godot export template) are technically the same which are normally static library built for debug or release target. The approach above I did should produce the same result.    **Minimal reproduction project:**  Simple to create. Create a new project, then add a new root node and Sprite node as a child. Then export iOS.      - [x] I searched the existing [GitHub issues](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+) for potential duplicates.  "

When the license advertisment is shown and Caret loses focus, said ad is hidden instantly. Caret losing focus implies clicking outside of its window boundaries or focusing another application.

This is even true after the timer runs out, thus, taking the ability to actually hit `Esc` and remove the `div`-container. Removing it can only be done by restarting the application.

I suspect this is related to the roadmap, not an syntax error or type-o.    ##### Request/Bug:  *Pretty please with sugar* make it work again. I understand roadmaps and structure and maybe it wasn't ""supposed"" to work in the first place, but *""Archive"" should be automatically created when/if ""Sent"", ""Drafts"", ""Trash"", and ""Junk"" are if the Archive plugin is active.*    ###### Considerations & What About...?:  - I've tried putting `$archive_mbox = $RCMAIL->config->get('archive_mbox');` in some files here and there (ie. `func.inc` line 274) and still can't make it work. So, no code contribution from me.  - What about just integrating the Archive plugin into the core and turning it on with a boolean setting in `config.inc.php`? Just sayin'.  - In the long run, why not do core-integration with other plugins as well, so composer doesn't break them and to bestow the ""my plugin became core"" honor on their authors and make everyone's life easier, including the Roundcube team?

I've been using requery to reconstuct the stored procs but some are rather involved. In doing so I've run into an issue. I think that if one runs a query of the form:    ```  entityDataStore.raw(""EXECUTE SOME_STORED_PROC @VALUE = ?"", value)  ```  That the RawTupleQuery has a queryType of SELECT, meaning that the statement is wrapped in a TupleResult. It looks like either if an exception is thrown while executing the query or if one immediately calls close on this object, there's no reference to connection close().    In BaseResult, we look for open iterators and close them. Is there some other way to use requery to support this use case, or is requery even intended for this use?

__label__bug "Selecting and deleting tags via keys not working in Chrome ### Issue  The following keys are not working with respect to deleting and selecting tags if one uses Chrome (63.0 Developer Build): Backspace, Delete, Left/Right    ### Possible Fix  Apparently one has to distinguish the behaviour of different browsers regarding the JQuery EventListener Variables `keypress`, `keydown` and `keyup`:  [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4843472/javascript-listener-keypress-doesnt-detect-backspace/4843502](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4843472/javascript-listener-keypress-doesnt-detect-backspace/4843502)    For me it was sufficient to alter tagsinput.js by changing `keypress` to `keydown`  in   `this.input.addEventListener('keypress', (e) => {`  to  `this.input.addEventListener('keydown', (e) => {`  in the `enable()` function and subsequently hardcoding the keycode `188` of  the delimiter `, `from  `if (key === 13 || key === this.options.delimiter.charCodeAt(0) || key === 9) `  to   `if (key === 13 || key === this.options.delimiter.charCodeAt(0) || key === 188  || key === 9) `  since keydown refers to actual key codes, not ascii codes.

__label__bug "Tag selecting of key events is not working properly ### Issue  Tag selection of the following keyevents isn't working properly: Backspace, Delete, ArrowKeys  In detail:  - After the backspace key event - deleting a selected tag - the tag left to the deleted tag isn't selected.

Instead no tag is selected.  - The arrow key events - selecting a tag left or right -  are not working at all.     ### Possible Fix  The JS commands `selectedTag.nextSibling` (`selectedTag.previousSibling`) doesn't yield the sibling `span.tag` element but the sibling `div.control` element which posses the `span.tag` in second order as a child knot. It was sufficient for me to change in tagsinput.js all `select` commands from  `this.select(selectedTag.nextSibling);`  (`this.select(selectedTag.previousSibling);`  to  `this.select($(selectedTag.nextSibling).find('span').get(0));`  (`this.select($(selectedTag.previousSibling).find('span').get(0));`)    "

__label__bug "Tag selection by backspace key for empty input line not working (Chrome) ### Issue  If the caret of the input line is at the very start and no tag is selected, pressing the backspace key won't select the first tag left to the input line for Chrome (63.0 Developer Build).  It may be that this is only the case if the proposed fix of [Issue #6: Selecting and deleting tags via keys not working in Chrome](#6) is applied to the `keypress` EventListener by changing `keypress` to `keydown`.    ### Possible fix  In tagsinput.js, the `caretAtStart(el)` function should take an input element as argument, not a `keydown` event (probably also not the `keypress` event, I can't test this at the moment). It was sufficient for me to change the `atStart` variables in the `init()` and the `addTag()` functions  from  `atStart = this.caretAtStart(e);`     (e is the `keydown`  EventListener Listener)   to  `atStart = this.caretAtStart(this.input);` .

__label__question "Animating backgroundColor from an empty state to a state with a color value throws an error The error thrown is:    `Error: Expected 1 or 4 constructor parameters.`    This is coming from the `Color` constructor. Looks like the property's `valueConverter` is called from `parseKeyframeDeclarations` with a value which is already a `Color` instance, which is then passed into the `Color` constructor, which in turn doesn't expect it and throws the error. In fact, this might be a core NativeScript issue, because `valueConverter` expects a string.    This can be easily reproduced by running the following example, which throws as soon as it initializes as it transitions into the ""inactive"" state:    https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-angular/blob/eb3fd81c7bb4cdb9938feea13cd9e34b868e451a/ng-sample/app/examples/animation/animation-states-test.ts    Or the following simplified testcase:    ```typescript  import { Component } from ""@angular/core"";  import { trigger, style, animate, state, transition } from ""@angular/animations"";    @Component({      selector: ""animation-states"",      template: `          <StackLayout>              <Button text=""Touch me!""

I got on the console:        netia9000       3       -52         e8:11:23:43:bf:a2:8f        10      -- other wi fi networks available nearby --    So it looks like the wifi module is fine and it's a software problem. I wrote the code according to [the documentation][1]. At this point I have no idea what's wrong. Any suggestions?      [1]: https://nodemcu.readthedocs.io/en/master/en/modules/wifi/#wifistaconfig"

__label__question Plugin Serialization My previous MapWindow4 plugin implement overrides for ProjectLoading and ProjectSaving methods to add plugin specific state information that I wanted to save/serialize to the project file.  Looking through MapWindow5 I'm not finding an obvious replacement.  Unfortunately I'm more of a C++ guy than a C# guy but it looks like MW5 is leveraging the DataContractSerializer (wrapped by DataContractSerializer) to serialize XmlProject which has DataMembers that reference just about everything else.  The only Plugin Serialization that is done though appears to via the Plugins property of tthe XmlProject.  Unfortunately XmlPlugin is only one that doesn't use the DataContract and DataMember attributes.....  How is a plugin developer supposed to serialize to the project file?  Thought I'd ask just in case someone already knows this answer.  I'll continue digging.  Thanks!

__label__question "[IDEA] Generic object to delay work Hi,  I don't know how do you handle your jobs, but I end up creating a lot of small jobs whenever an operation do more than 2 HTTP calls to other services, or when I know the task will take some time.  To that extent, I have a lot of small jobs, whose only job is simply delaying to the service layer. For instance:  ``` php class DeleteUserJob extends AbstractJob {      private $userService;       public function __construct(UserService $userService)      {            $this->userService = $userService;      }       public function execute()      {           $this->userService->deleteUser($this->content['user_id']);      } } ```  I have tons of them and it's only boring to write. Couldn't we actually think of a way to make this more transparent and avoid all that boilerplate code?  I kinda like the work on Laravel and ""delayed commands"" (http://laravel.com/docs/5.0/bus). I'm not an expert of this bus command stuff, but it seems that each command can be decided to be delayed, by appending some kind of ""delay handler"". "

__label__question "Completion for added prototype methods ## Info    - Platform: macOS  - Vetur version: 0.11.5  - VS Code version: 1.19.1    ## Problem    It's possible to add additional prototype methods to Vue:    ```javascript    Vue.prototype.$myMethod = function (methodOptions) {      // something logic ...    }  ```    This is accessible from within a component using `this.$myMethod()`.    However, code completion does not work. When I type `this.` then `$myMethod()` is not listed as one of the options. All the other built-in Vue options work, so I know vetur is working properly.    Is completion for prototype methods possible, and is there a special way it needs to be set up? I did not see anything in the documentation.     I'm inclined to think I'd need to extend the Vue type definitions. This is for a JavaScript project (not TypeScript)."

__label__question Transferring grains without persistence on silo shutdown We are currently running a small Orleans cluster without using persistence.    I am trying to understand how I can handle a shutdown of a silo in the most graceful way possible. This is part of our planning for in place upgrades of our silo cluster while retaining grain state.

__label__question "Loading all AL files of an application in the VS Code folder makes the project uncompileable I have converted all delta files of our application to AL files (with txt2Al). When I put all the AL files in the VSCode project folder, the extra objects appear in VS Code.  When pressing F5, ctrl+F5 or F6, nothing happens. Even with ctrl+shift+b, the application isn't build. Because the application can't be build, no problems are detected.  No output is shown, nor anything happend in the event viewer why it failed to build.    However when I load only a small part of the objects into the folder (example: all tables), you can compile and problems occur.  Some of these problems are caused by missing objects (functions in codeunits or properties like lookuppageID). These problems wouldn't occur if the application AL files would be loaded into the project all at once (after multiple iterate compilations)."
__label__question "Linking to images in same directory with Markdown? Hi. I'd like to link to image files that I keep in the same directory as my .Rmd file.  With .Rmd on my computer the images render fine.

But using blogdown::serve(), the images are broken. I figure this has something to do with how Hugo handles images. Image files can't be in the same directory as the .Rmd files? I see that for the figure files that are generated from the .Rmd internally (plots, etc.), the files go into a `figure-html` directory automatically. But for the straight external images that I keep bundled in the .Rmd parent directory, they don't show.     Is there a fix for this?          "

__label__question TargetReplicaSetSize and MinReplicaSetSize on stateful services documentation I find it difficult to find information about the TargetReplicasetSize and MinReplicaSetSize.    A lot of examples use for example TargetReplicaSetSize=5 and MinReplicaSetSize=3.    As per documentation (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.fabric.description.statefulservicedescription.minreplicasetsize.aspx) the above scenario would support 3 simultaneous failures and still maintain quorum and write capability.    Is it true that going for TargetReplicaSetSize=4 and MinReplicaSetSize=3 would instead support 2 simultaneous failures while maintaining quorum?    Is it totally okay to have TargetReplicaSetSize (or MinReplicaSetSize) that is even number? Are there any downsides to having even number TargetReplicaSetSize?

__label__question "Can prepack run on itself? This is 100% not an issue but a question, so sorry for posting this here, but I don't see any other way to talk to the prepack community (any gitter/slack/etc channels?).    I'm having too much fun using prepack with interpreters & compilers. Today I was able to turn my interpreter, which interprets high-level instructions, almost into a compiler by running prepack on it with a given source code: https://twitter.com/jlongster/status/948247424023322624    I say ""almost"" because I don't really have a compiler yet. Prepack is running my VM and outputting the JS code itself. Evidently this is called [Futamura projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_evaluation#Futamura_projections). Since prepack isn't very fast though, this isn't extremely practical. I want just the raw compiler itself.    What I learned from that wiki page is we can take this even further. Supposedly I can generate an actual compiler by ""specializing the specializer for the interpreter"" - meaning run prepack on a program that runs prepack on the interpreter.    That would require prepack being able to run on itself. Is that possible? I'm going to try it tonight but given this is all blowing my mind, and I'm sure I'll run into problems, I'd like to know if anyone has tried that yet.    "

__label__question "CachedImage App Freeze and Memory Problems I am using a Xamarin Forms ListView to display images from the internet. (ListView has HasUnevenRows=true and no caching strategy defined, if of any relevance.)    These images are 400x400 max. jpeg images. They range between 24KB-145KB. I am showing 3 images in each row. Xamarin image views are 100x100 and I am using Samsung Galaxy S3 for testing (pixel ratio:2).    The problem is, when using CachedImage (FFImageLoding.Forms 2.2.9), I get out of memory exceptions as I start to scroll past about the middle of the list and some of the image views start to show empty. When I inspected, the size of these images are sometimes 30 KB, sometimes 90 KB. So size of the image is irrelevant.    I tried using CacheType=Disk, thinking that each seen image is cached in memory, but the result was the same    I tried setting DownSampleHeight and DownSampleWidth properties to 100. Then the out of memory exceptions went away and scroll became smoother. But the problem was that, when I was testing by scrolling constantly and quickly up and down the list, app freezed and never recovered. I tried again and the same result. I could not understand why, do you have an idea?    Another thing is, images are already of small size. With a Samsung Galaxy S8 (pixel ratio:4), there won't be any need to downsample anyway, so aside from the freeze, I feel like downsampling should not be necessary anyway.    So, I tried using the standard Image view of Xamarin Forms instead of CachedImage. It worked fine without any out of memory exceptions. (But since there is no downsampling here, I guess scrolling was not as smooth as the CachedImage with downsampling.)  And when I tested by scrolling constantly and quickly up and down the list, app did not freeze at all.    Bottom line is,    1. How come the standard Xamarin Forms Image view is not causing out of memory exceptions but CachedImage is, when not using downsampling?  2. What can be the reason of app freezing when using CachedImage with downsampling and doing constant and quick scrolling?    "
__label__question "Question about memory requirements I ran into problems with memory requirements. Initializing 68 data sources (Turtle files) with slightly more than 3 million triples in total results in a ""JavaScript heap out of memory"" exception. Merging all sources into one large source gives same result. I could get the server running with node option `--max-old-space-size` but it's still slow and the memory consumption seems rather high. Can you give some numbers of expected memory requirements and/or limitations? What do you recommend to server several million triples as LDF?    It looks like large data sets can only be used via SPARQL or external HDT files (or write your own data source that talks to an indexed set of triples, maybe I should do this for BEACON files)."

I went back to the menu functions and selected the DEBUG to make adjustments which did not help in get the notch filter working.    I went back to the <>Code to see if I missed something I was to set but I couldn't see anything I missed.    At this point I went back to version 2.7.31. This version works the beat for my clone radio. Although I still get audio muting sometimes when I let up on the PTT. Then I have restart the radio to get the audio back.    Best regards  WM0I    "

__label__question "GetEGRID returns list or object? In the specification is written, that the method GetEGRID should return a list with the matched properties, but the [JSON schema](https://github.com/camptocamp/pyramid_oereb/blob/aa4dbe85bf26d63bffeddf1d108c50bfac8bc317/pyramid_oereb/tests/resources/schema_webservices.json#L53-L63) defines only one object to be returned.

__label__question "documentation to extend Quran app for Hifz First of all,     May Allah Reward you and Bless you for opensourcing this amazing work. I'm a father, currently trying to help his son learn the Quran. he has learnt a few Juz, but now is struggling with his historical chapters (manzil). I'm trying to find patterns and track progress so our revisions can become much more efficient, but since we use a paper quran, the annotations become very convoluted and hard to follow.     That has made me look towards an IOS app on the ipad to help with this... I am trying to extend your app to be able to annotate on it to track his mistakes and trend them over time.     **1. Word by word:**  However, i'm trying to track this not by page but by ayah, and ideally by word. I'd started to create my own app pulling gif Quran pages down from the internet but soon realized this would not allow me to track to the level of granularity (i'd only be able to track # of mistakes/stucks/tajweed issues by page).    it was when I saw in one of your bug fixes that you have introduced word by word translation, started thinking  you have to have metadata recorded per word somewhere, which is exactly what I want to extend to add history of the mistakes with that word, and the datestamp when recorded.    **2. annotations per page**  I am also wanting to extend some visuals, track annotations page by page, something like this image below.     ![mockup-of-annotations](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2871971/34701447-df146674-f4ad-11e7-9c11-069218e0f755.png)      These same annotations would drive the new metadata per word I was mentioning in #1 so in the above example something like     dateReviewed,surah#,page#,ayah#,word#,typeOfIssue  010618,002,003,008,007,Mistake  010618,002,003,008,009,Mistake  010618,002,003,010,008,TajwidError  010618,002,003,010,009,TajwidError  010618,002,003,010,013,TajwidError  ... and so on...  I've shown only the first 2 mistakes and 3 tajwid errors on the page in the metadata, but you get the idea...    since i'm sort of a newbie IOS developer, i'm trying to learn this over weekends; i'm not as adept in knowing where to look right now. once I understand how ios unit test framework works (like the maven convention for src/tests/...) I'll try to learn backwards from there as well..    at this point though, i'm quite lost!     I had a few questions if you could help me start off on...    1. Q1 how could I go about understanding where you keep metadata for your ayahs , and what the documentation or schema is.. so I can extend it for #1 above  2. Q2 any tips on how I can go about adding the columns and annotations on each page as shown, e.g. how do you render the page, where would i be adding these columns, and any other ideas on what Objects in the object library in your estimation would be best suited to capture these. I was thinking TableView and TableViewCell, but ended up crashing Xcode trying to add columns!  3. Q3 finally  do you have any basic documentation or pointers where I could start to understand your code has been laid out. historically when trying to reverse engineer code, I start from the file which the front page references and then categorically document each call from there on... but in this case , because of my own weak knowledge, i dont even know what file that would be :)       JAK again for your support and may Allah give you Jaza for every line of code you've written for this app and every bug you've fixed and each feature you've produced.. InshaAllah if I can extend your app to enable my child's hifz to become more efficient, May Allah Give you the Reward of his becoming a Hafiz too one day. Ameen      "

This leads to the following use case which is not possible to implement right now with a pure required validation setup:  ""The whole address field-set is optional unless somebody fills out one of the following fields: address.street, address.city, address.line1""    Schema:    ```  new SimpleSchema({       notOkayCase: {          type: Object,          blackbox: true,          required: true,        },        notOkayCaseTwo: {          type: Object,          blackbox: true,          required: true,        },        'notOkayCaseTwo.a': {          type: String,          required: false,        },        'notOkayCaseTwo.b': {          type: String,          required: false,          vi: { fieldid: 'b' },        },        okayCase: {          type: Object,          required: false,        },        'okayCase.a': {          type: String,          required: true,        },        'okayCase.b': {          type: String,          required: true,        },  })  ```    I use the Simple Schema 2 Bridge."

__label__question "Questions while creating a more complex example Hi Guys,  I wish you a Merry Christmas.    I am trying to create an example to demonstrate the usage of our pipeline. I want to count all the words in a text file and print the 10 most used words (this problem just calls for a pipeline).    To solve this problem, I want to create a pipeline consisting out of the following 5 tasks:    - Task 1 reads the file line by line and forwards the read line to task 2.  - Task 2 separates the line into words and forwards each individual word to task 3.  - Task 3 converts each letter in a word to uppercase and forwards the word consisting only out of uppercase letters to task 4.  - Task 4 saves and counts the words. Every n words it triggers Task 5.  - Task 5 prints the top 10 most used words to the console.    I am unsure to implement the following behavior using our framework/pattern:  When created, task 1 opens a text file. Task 1 ""can_run"", because the EOF of the file has not been reached and Task 2 can process the next line (how do I know this?). So, Task 1 reads the next line and writes it to its output. Task 1 cannot run anymore because there is data in its output. Task 2 can run now because there is data in its input. Task 2 takes the line and begins processing it. At that moment Task 1 should be runnable again because its output has been read (how do I know this?). Now Task 1 reads the next line and writes it to its output while Task 2 is still processing the first line while handing the individual words down to Task 3.    My concrete sticking points are:    1. Task 2 ""can_run"" if it is still processing a line or if a new line is waiting in its input. Which run method should the scheduler call (every run forwards an individual word to Task 3)?  2. How does the scheduler know that Task 2 has read the output of Task 1 so it can execute Task 1 again?    There exist implementations where there are buffers between the tasks which store the input and output values. For example:    Say, there was a buffer 1 between Task 1 and Task 2 and a buffer 2 after Task 2 for example. Both, Task 1 and Task 2 can access buffer 1 while Task 2 has additional access to buffer 2. If buffer 1 is empty, the scheduler can obviously run Task 1 which writes a new line to buffer 1. Task 2 can be run, if buffer 2 is empty and (there is data in buffer 1 or Task 2 is still processing a line). If task 2 wasn't processing a line it would fetch the next line from buffer 1 which would enable task 1 to be run again.  "

__label__question "The choice of the number of quantizers per subvector in IndexIVFPQ Hi there,    I'm running IndexIVFPQ and notice that when I set nbits (the number bits to index sub-codebook) to 16 (2 bytes), FAISS would throw an assertion failure saying that nbits should be equal or less than 8. This would put a restriction on the maximal number of codewords per subvector to 256.     My understanding of PQ is that increasing nbits would significantly increase the number of codewords that can be represented without increasing memory footprint too much. This is because the total number of codewords is (2^nbits)^m (where m is the number of subvectors), the codebook size is (i.e., m * (2^nbits)), and the number of bytes per vector is (m * nbits / 8). Hence, increasing nbits will likely yield to a better memory-recall tradeoff.     The place where the exception is thrown is at the following place:  Error in faiss::IndexIVFPQ::IndexIVFPQ(faiss::Index*, size_t, size_t, size_t, size_t) at IndexIVFPQ.cpp:50: Error: 'nbits_per_idx <= 8' failed.   Also, in Figure 6 of the paper ""product quantization for nearest neighbor search"", K* is set to 4096, which is equivalent to nbits set to 12. I wonder if there are any particular reasons that in the current implementation nbits is limited to 8, and what I can do to increase nbits to larger values such as 16?        "

Something like this:    ```  postRepository  .findAll()  .mapWithMono((post)->commentsRepository.count(post), (post, commentsCount) -> {      post.setCount(commentsCount);       return post;  })  ```    With streams I'd like to do  something like:    ```  postRepository  .findAll()  .stream()  .map(post -> post.setCommentsCount(commentsRepository.count(post))  .collect....  ```    I know that I can do .zipWith on flux but it takes a publisher not a function that will produce a publisher    Now, It's somehow possible with Mono by doing:    ```   @GetMapping(""posts/{id}"")      Mono<ResponseEntity<Post>> getPost(@PathVariable String id) {          return postRepository                  .findById(id)                  .zipWith(commentRepository.countCommentsByPostId(id), (post, commentsCount) -> {                      post.setCommentsCount(commentsCount);                      return post;                  })                  .map(ResponseEntity::ok)                  .defaultIfEmpty(ResponseEntity.notFound().build());      }    ```    But not with flux.

__label__question "Do we want to modify alipy? I am hoping by filing an ""issue"" here then an email chain gets triggered that goes to other members of this source repository. Is that right? Can anyone hear me?    I am looking at fixing two inter-related issues with the ioi pipeline.  i) Image registration fails on images with few, faint stars, but do look like registration ought to be possible.  ii) When image registration fails we get nothing out and the PI never sees the failed data. I propose we need to change the rules to still get the level 1 data product out, even if there is no level 2.    Both the above are easily fixable. My question is not really about ways to fix them, but what is our policy about maintenance of third party Python libraries on which we depend.    The registration is being performed by alipy (https://obswww.unige.ch/~tewes/alipy/index.html). RMB has copied their source code into this repository. I.e., I believe we are using our own forked copy of alipy, not using a library that is installed in the Python environment as a dependency.    If I want to change the way alipy works, are we simply going to edit our copies of the alipy source files that exist within this repository? Once we do that we will have diverged from the ""official"" alipy release and will not be able to simply take and run any new alipy distribution that appears.  Looking at the above web page, the last update was 2013, so it seems alipy is not under active development.    To give you some context, I will describe the changes I want to make. alipy uses SExtractor to detect stars within an image and it does the quad alignment matching on those SExtractor catlogues. The alipy.pysex module has a mechanism for passing in either or both of a SExtractor config file or individual SExtractor config items on a one-by-one basis. It has an alipy.pysex._check_files method that sets defaults for required parameters that have not be explicitly set. Overall that looks quite nice and flexible. On the other hand alipy.ImgCat.makecat() then hardcodes a load of SExtractor options with no way to pass in your own values. (e.g., Detect sources as 10 connected pixels at 3sigma threshold, assuming stellar FWHM is 2pix)  Some of those values are not quite ideal of IOI. They are generally pretty good and work most of the time, but it would be more convenient if those source detection parameters were set in the ioi_pipeline runtime config file rather than hardcoded in alipy.    In order to do that though, the alipy code needs to be slightly integrated into ioi_pipeline so that parameters can be passed through. alipy would cease to be a completely external, independent black box.    So, basically my question is do I dive in and edit our local forked copy of alipy? If I have understood the situation correctly, the only reasons not to do that are things like  i) there is a newer version somewhere I do not know about that already offers the functions I want  ii) we know that a new master version of alipy is about to be released  "

__label__question """Invalid Security Token"" on admin login page When I try to login as admin on the login page (domain.org/admin) I get an ""Invalid Security Token"" error.  Just the login is broken, the website is working fine. Oddly enough, yesterday everything worked fine.    Before I go into more detail, here are my stats:  The server runs Ubuntu 16.04.1  Apache version: 2.4.18  PHP 7.0.22  Yesterday I upgraded Grav from 1.3.8 to 1.3.10  The Grav website itself was build on a different system and copied to the server Apache folder.    Because my used credentials are correct (I tested them on a different server on the same website) and the meaning of this error message, I think that the problem has something to do with the generated admin-nonce.    As far as I understand the source code the nonce is a md5 hash of    ```  $unhashedNonce = $i . '|' . $action . '|' . $username . '|' . $token . '|' . Grav::instance()['config']->get('security.salt');    $i = (int)ceil(time() / ($secondsInHalfADay));  $token = sessionId();  $username = 'gravadmin';  $action = 'admin-form';    ```  -> [(./src/Grav/Common/Utils.php - line 678).](https://github.com/getgrav/grav/blob/develop/system/src/Grav/Common/Utils.php)    To grant access to the admin interface the admin-nonce is tested, if it is generated during the last 12h. Which is done by generating a new one and compare it to the passed nonce:  ```      public static function verifyNonce($nonce, $action)      {            [...]            //Nonce generated 0-12 hours ago          if ($nonce == self::getNonce($action)) {              return true;          }            [...]  ```  ->[ (./src/Grav/Common/Utils.php - line 759)](https://github.com/getgrav/grav/blob/develop/system/src/Grav/Common/Utils.php)    I guess the problem lies in the generation of the salt but I'm a beginner with PHP so I'm absolutely not sure about this.  Does anyone have a hint or even a solution?"

__label__question "Extend syntax to support other media types Hello,    I would like to make a suggestion to extend the syntax.    The goal of the extension is to be able to display other media types inline without breaking compatibility with other applications.   One use case could be ""inline display of latex formulas"".  Other use cases are conceivable.    The basic syntax extension I would suggest would be an extension of the markdown image syntax:        ![Alternative Text](path/to/image)    to         ![Alternative Text](path/to/cached_image){mediatype:mediastring}    e.g.        ![f(x): R -> R](path/to/cached_image){latex:f(x): \\mathbb\{R\} -> \\mathbb\{R\}}      The behaviour of an editor **supporting the syntax** and **supporting the media type** should then be:   - render and display the content in the curly braces   - cache the rendered output in an image file      - either at the specified location      - or generate a unique (random) image file name and place it in a cache folder using that name. (e.g. `media/`)   - don't display the alternative text      The behaviour of an editor **supporting the syntax** but **not supporting the media type** should then be:    - display the cached image    - don't display the alternative text or the text in the curly braces      Editors which **do not support the syntax** but **support images** would display:    - the cached image    - the text in the curly braces    Surely making such a general syntax, only makes sense when other apps would at some point also jump in and support this syntax. But until then, this extension would not break the display in other apps and other apps could even see the rendered content through the cached image.    The first question would be if something like this could be merged at some point.  This is not a completely finished idea but I would love to here some input from others.    I hope I was able to make my point.  If not, feel free to ask and I will try to enhance my description.      Thank you for reading."
__label__question "Particle Photon collapses Hy there  Thanks a lot for this library for free. Ther is a lot of work in. I was so happy when the u8x8 ""Hello World"" worked from beginning.  Unfortunately I became a problem with u8g2 with the Microcontroller ""Photon"" from Particle.  If I use u8x8, ""Hello World"" is displayed, with a Display similar to the Midas MCOT128128 but also with the SSD1327-Controller, perfectly.  But with u8g2, the microcontroller collapses allready at u8g2.begin(). First I thought there is not enough of RAM, but with ""System.freeMemory();"" I got, that when the u8x8-Hello world is running, I have more than 60 kByte of free RAM. That should be more than enough. Also because the ""Photon"" (120 MHz, 128 kByte RAM) is much more powerful than every Arduino. And ""Particle"" tried to make her system libraries very simmilar to Arduino.

__label__question "Question about connection pooling Hi, I have read the docs/examples but still confused about connection pooling.  First my req's:  1. maintain a pool of bound connections to the LDAP server.    2. These connections will be used synchronously to interact with my LDAP server.  3. When dao function is finished with connection, it simply returns it to the pool, shouldn't need to unbind/close the socket to the server.  4. A worker thread (in my program) may only access one LDAP connection at a time.  5. No two threads may access the same LDAP connection.    Here is how I am (attempting to) initialize the connection the server connection pool:  server = ldap3.Server( host='localhost', port=389 )  c = ldap3.Connection(server, user=service_uid, password=service_pw, auto_bind=True, collect_usage=True, pool_name='blah', pool_size=5, pool_lifetime=600, pool_keepalive=30 )    My confusion is two-fold:  a. how to get a new connection from the pool.  do I just call the code as listed above, or is there another way?  b. how do I return a connection to the pool?    Any samples you can point me to are appreciated.  Thanks in advance for your attention to this.      Shawn McKinney"

__label__question "task with other promise implementations Hi.    We're using Bluebird as our promise implementation in a project, and I'd like to use `Task` in there too. Alas, `Task` enforces standard ES6 promises. At the moment, I've basically copied the entire `Task.ts` file into my own project and `s/Promise/Bluebird/` and `s/Task/BTask/`. This is working fine for me, but obviously I'd be better off if `fp-ts` supported either promise library natively.     I think supporting both seems tricky though, unless you know of some magic generics incantation or something.....    Any ideas?     Cheers"
__label__question "Suggestion: Avoid the use of global configuration and objects I found this library while looking for modern and easy ways of adding localization to my Node service. It's pretty much the only one which uses string tag functions and still supports standard variable replacements without inventing a new syntax. Brilliant! However, it doesn't seem to suite my use case as I'll have to handle multiple different translations in parallel, e.g. respond to parallel requests in different languages. Or maybe I just don't really understand how to use it?    I'm looking for something where I can instantiate multiple `i18n` string tag functions, each with a different locale and string table. I thus forked this repo locally and built something that works more like this:    ```js  import { I18n } from ""./i18"";    const i18n = I18n.create({ locales: ""de"" });  console.log(i18n`Hello ${name}, you have ${amount}:c in your bank account.`);  // => Hallo Steffen, Sie haben US$ 1,250.33 auf Ihrem Bankkonto.  ```    I feel this is a cleaner interface and better scoped. Would that be something to consider for a v2 of this lib? What are your thoughts about this?"

__label__question "Python plugin API for OpenShot a good method for persistent data? (I had posted on the user forum and was directed here due to the nature of the question)    This may seem redundant at first since one can program plugins in Blender and can access openshotlib via Python, but I have pointed out some fine details and use cases of having this type of API that would open up whole new categories of plugins...    I would like to help OpenShot to be able to write plugins (and I would like to write plugins) such as frame-painting plugins; another category of plugins that generate or use motion estimation data (such as anti-shake or motion matching plugins--they could even both get the data from the same motion estimation plugin else show error on screen if motion estimation info is not available for the frame of the footage file); and possibly other categories of plugins which would also use persistent data in some way. Both categories of plugins would be highly dependent on footage staying the same, so py (or however programmed) plugins may need to be required to have a get_context_list function that could return [""footage"",""clip"",""track"",""master""] (but that would return only [""media""] in this case). There definitely would need to be a warning but not necessarily block the person if they want to risk frame painting on a clip such as after a color adjustment effect. There would also need to be a get_content_list function that would return something like [""video""] or [""audio""] or [""image""] or [""video"",""image""]. The py file should be able to get and set info somehow such as:  ```  openshot.plugin_context.media.content_string #returning [""video""] or [""audio""] or [""image""]  openshot.plugin_context.media.path #returning full path of clip, such as to store motion estimation data to the same folder  #also store persistent data in memory (of arbitrary name and type) between frames:  if openshot.plugin_context.my_variable_1 is not None:      openshot.plugin_context.my_variable_1 = QImage() #pretend I wrote something legit after the equal sign  #where plugin_context is the instance of the plugin as applied to a specific media object  #it may also need to get the frame number and rate or timecode (at least global time, but possibly also time relative to clip), such as for beat matching, or so it can have an option to reset a cumulative effect such as motion blur  ```  Regarding uses of such an API not highly dependent on unchanging sources, but that might also require a python API or other API, named outputs and inputs (that can be piped together) would be great--such as a plugin that detects and outputs ""bass"" from audio track, then that (0 to 1) value can be used as an input for a brightness (or other) video plugin selectable from drop-down (possibly node interface if anyone wants to program that).    I recommend against writing a plugin API that requires binary plugins, since that is a big pain for developers (such as, if I go on another computer, I have to make sure my IDE is setup properly there and possibly deal with version issues related to Qt or other libraries). Also, I know that libopenshot is accessible from Python and that I would be able to write my own video editing program, but that is not really interesting to me. I'd rather stick with OpenShot since it already has a great interface). I don't currently know the coding of OpenShot in depth, nor future plans--so that's why I ask, is writing a Python API for OpenShot a good idea to accomplish these goals?"

Is using the fixed-point implementation on worlds containing roughly (low)hundreds of bodies at all feasible?    - How do the float-types impact maximum scale ratios between bodies in this engine? Can this get me beyond Box2D's 0.1m - 10m rule for bodys' sizes and maybe even beyond 0.1m - ~1000m?    - Apart from namespacing and renaming - what are the most obvious pitfalls one might encounter migrating from Box2D to PlayRho in an existing project?    - Are there any plans to implement liquidfun's additions to Box2D in PlayRho? (ParticleSystems)    - I read about 3D in the issues - will this project move away from a pure 2D engine? and if so will the API for the 2D usage as well as the 2D performance of the engine change/suffer due to that change?    My hopes are that i can more or less drop in PlayRho as a replacement for Box2D and get a similar performance but stronger determinism (syncing Box2D over network is... tedious to say the least) on a larger range of scale.

However the whole function is taking on average 5 secs and sometimes up to 10 seconds to implement. I can't understand how to optimise code.     Here is the editImage function which implements async.waterfall, where source image from s3 bucket is downloaded.

__label__question "Nested ternaries aren't bad, just misused The argument against nested ternaries is that they can make code more difficult to understand. But they can make code easier to understand if they are wielded properly. Instead of banning nested ternaries, require that they are formatted such that **each line has a single condition and a single result**, with the catch-all at the end:    ```  // bad  const foo = maybe1 > maybe2    ? ""bar""    : value1 > value2 ? ""baz"" : null;    // good  const foo =    maybe1 > maybe2 ? ""bar""    : value1 > value2 ? ""baz""    : null;  ```    This is similar to a switch statement that always `break`s. With this pattern, it's impossible to get lost in nested contexts. Once you've ruled out a line applying to the case you're considering, you can safely forget it. It's easier to understand than the solutions provided by the style guide right now, and also saves a memory allocation.    Here are some other examples where this pattern improves code:    ```  // bad  let result;  if (operator === ‘+’) {    result = left + right;  } else if (operator === ‘*’) {    result = left * right;  } else if (operator === ‘-’) {    result = left — right;  } else {    result = left / right;  }    // good  const result =    operator === ‘+’ ? left + right    : operator === ‘*’ ? left * right    : operator === ‘-’ ? left — right    : left / right;  ```    * Less code.  * Prefers `const` over `let`.  * Avoids side effects (i.e. assigning value of variable outside block scope).    ```  // bad  if (conditionA) {    outcome1();  } else if (conditionB) {    if (conditionC) {      outcome2();    } else {      outcome3();    }  } else {    outcome4();  }    // good  conditionA ? outcome1()  : conditionB && conditionC ? outcome2()  : conditionB ? outcome3()  : outcome4();  ```  * Less code.  * Less cognitive load.

__label__question "Usage outside of Java projects I came across Karate while looking for automated API testing tools and found that it seemed to meet my requirements really nicely. However, after trying to get it to work all day within the context of a Go project, I've came to the conclusion it's not intended to be used outside of Java projects. Ideally I'd be able to test my API endpoints with minimal Java stuff cluttering up my Go project. However, after creating the pom.xml, build.gradle and comparing what I have to what the read / examples have, I'm not sure why my test runner and feature files aren't being detected. I believe it's because I do not have a src directory and ideally, I do not want to follow Java directory structures."

__label__question "Question: Automate naming and packaging I'm not familiar with gulp to know how to change the code or if my idea is even worth changing! From my understanding is FoundationPress is a set of starter files, like underscores for WordPress. So I can take FoundationPress and rename it to my shiny new theme name.    However [http://underscores.me/](http://underscores.me/) has a generate page that will go through, theme name, slug, author, author uri, description and generate your parent starter theme zip package. I think it even rename the functions to your theme name as well. So is there a way of replicating this setup for FoundationPress for those who want use the starter files but under a different theme name?    Otherwise once I have `git clone [...] my-new-theme`, I then need to manually update styles.css and package.json with the new theme name. So given npm generates everything else could using the config.yml to automatically populate style.css details and change the package.json 'name' so when you `npm run package` you will get your new zipped theme named and generated. Rather then be left with the default `foundationpress-[date].zip` and if you have remebered to change the styles.css file.     I'm think this is more useful when you have finally finished developing you're parent theme and want to use versions numbers for updates after each `npm run package`.. I'm not totally sure if my thinking is even correct and I'm sure something like this has come up before, although I couldn't find reference to it. But FP with npm and gulp does such a good job of automating everything else apart from dealing with with those wanting use FoundationPress as SomethingElsePress.  "

My current issue now is informing the player to attempt to reconnect on failed connections, currently working around this by waiting for the media state to end, then programmatically telling the player to play the same stream again.    Something along the lines of MediaElement.ReConnect(bool RetryOnFail, int RetryAttempts, int TimeBetweenAttemptsInMs)    If there's a way to do this outside of the api, without hacking it too much, lemme know.    Edit:  I have located the Options inputted into MediaInitializingRoutedEventArgs, which i think i manipulate for now, but exposing something like MediaElement.Options to add options to the player before playing the video would be beneficial.     Edit 2:  Filing tickets at 5AM on little sleep is a bad idea kids. Solution to manipulating the Http headers/user agent and reconnect attempts is to add a new event to Media Initializing event handler to the player.  Here you can add options to the MediaInitializingRoutedEventArgs passed (e.Option.Input). Which should take effect before starting the stream. Going to test for effectiveness.     Edit 3:  This issue seems to be at FFMPEGs level. Further looking into it, there doesn't seem to be any command line arguments to attempt to reconnect to a forbidden or 404 more than once. I will keep this up dated but it seems like this might have to be handled by reading when FFMPEG fails and try to reconnect using the same video buffer if it succeeds."

__label__question "ID method for Oly gonad diff. methylation analysis Need to determine which method to use to measure diff. methylation in my Oly samples. I am preparing 16 samples total (8 per treatment), but might not run them all.  I currently am not planning on targeting any genes, rather using the analysis to ID global differences and diff. methylated regions.     What method is reasonable? I thought RRBS might be an option but according to [Kurdyukov 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4810160/pdf/biology-05-00003.pdf) it's $2500/sample. I see [Jay](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/03/22/119156) used EpiRadSeq on ~25 samples and was able to obtain SNP data, too. [Jiang 2016 paper](http://rdcu.be/FMIv) looked at gigas methylation between parent/offspring via fluorescent-labeled methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism (F-MSAP), and @sr320 you also mentioned ELISA?    Note: if all goes as planned, I will want to analyze larval samples later on, which are frozen and will have much less tissue.  I presume it's best to use the same technique for both adult gonad and larvae, if possible.   "

This is an unfortunate consequence of the naming convention where `mkFoo` is promoted to `MkFoo`.    Now, I quite like this naming convention, so I'm not proposing we change that. Rather, I propose something more... modest? I propose that we not generate defunctionalization symbols for the `MkFoo` constructor at all.    After all, we don't need to! Promoted constructors are one of the few things that can currently be partially applied at the type level in GHC, so instead of using defunctionalization symbols, we can just use `'MkFoo`, `TyCon1 'MkFoo`, and `TyCon2 'MkFoo` as appropriate. This would require changing some code generation in `singletons` to accommodate the change, but I think it would be possible.    The downside to this proposal is that some folks quite like having defunctionalization symbols for constructors. We could make this opt-in by still allowing users to write `$(genDefunSymbols [''Foo])` if they really want it. However, this behavior would _not_ be implied by `promote` or `singletons`."

__label__question "Add support for required flag to input filters I know this is not a discussion board or Stack Overflow, however, having tried to find a solution to my problem (which I'm sure I'm not only one having) I wanted to raise a discussion about the following issue. There's a possibility that I've missed something along the way but I'll ask nonetheless.    Currently there doesn't seem to be a way to set input filter nested inside another input filter as required. Requirements seem to be based on the input (and not input filter) nearest to the root of the object.    To illustrate what I mean, assume the following API endpoint payload, which eventually gets converted to a PHP array:    ```json  {    ""root"": {      ""branch"": {        ""leaf"": false      }    }  }  ```    If understand correctly then the only way to build validation for the specified structure is to have an input filter class for the whole object, which has an input filter attached for the `root` key, which in turn has an input filter class attached for `branch`. The latter one then has an input attached to it validating the value.    In my use case, it is not required to specify `branch` when posting the payload, however, if it's present, `leaf` has to be validated to make sure that the value is a boolean value.    Currently the only way to avoid the `Value is required and can't be empty` on the `leaf` property is to set is as not required, which obviously isn't how it should be.    I've been looking through the source code and, correct me if I'm wrong, but it doesn't look like there's any functionality allowing to specify that a nested input filter is required or not. Is it a deliberate decision or something that's not been implemented or requested? Alternatively, maybe there's a different solution to achieve the same exact result I need?"

__label__question "Invalid object name 'Clients' Hello,  I am trying to generate migrations from a project hosting the Identity Server 4.  The project is configured with .NET core 2 and using the NUGET packages:    - IdentityServer4 (2.1.1)  - IdentityServer4.EntityFramework (2.1.1)    I've configured the Startup.cs as it should be, for instance:    ````  .AddConfigurationStore(options =>   {  	options.ConfigureDbContext = builder =>  		builder.UseSqlServer(connectionString,  		sql => sql.MigrationsAssembly(migrationsAssembly));  })  ````  Also, I've added a DesignTimeFactory class as follows:    ````  public ConfigurationDbContext CreateDbContext(string[] args)          {              IConfigurationRoot configuration = new ConfigurationBuilder()                  .SetBasePath(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory())                  .AddJsonFile(""appsettings.json"")                  .Build();              var builder = new DbContextOptionsBuilder<ConfigurationDbContext>();              var connectionString = configuration.GetConnectionString(""DefaultConnection"");              builder.UseSqlServer(connectionString, o => o.MigrationsAssembly(typeof(DesignTimeConfigurationDbContextFactory).GetTypeInfo().Assembly.GetName().Name));              var options = new ConfigurationStoreOptions();              return new ConfigurationDbContext(builder.Options, options);          }  ````  Then, I create an empty Database manually.

__label__question "HLS: Retry Failed Connections Currently working with HLS, and the streaming server isn't know for stability.     My current issue now is informing the player to attempt to reconnect on failed connections, currently working around this by waiting for the media state to end, then programmatically telling the player to play the same stream again.    Something along the lines of MediaElement.ReConnect(bool RetryOnFail, int RetryAttempts, int TimeBetweenAttemptsInMs)    If there's a way to do this outside of the api, without hacking it too much, lemme know.    Edit:  I have located the Options inputted into MediaInitializingRoutedEventArgs, which i think i manipulate for now, but exposing something like MediaElement.Options to add options to the player before playing the video would be beneficial.     Edit 2:  Filing tickets at 5AM on little sleep is a bad idea kids. Solution to manipulating the Http headers/user agent and reconnect attempts is to add a new event to Media Initializing event handler to the player.  Here you can add options to the MediaInitializingRoutedEventArgs passed (e.Option.Input). Which should take effect before starting the stream. Going to test for effectiveness.     Edit 3:  This issue seems to be at FFMPEGs level. Further looking into it, there doesn't seem to be any command line arguments to attempt to reconnect to a forbidden or 404 more than once. I will keep this up dated but it seems like this might have to be handled by reading when FFMPEG fails and try to reconnect using the same video buffer if it succeeds."

That step resulted in the similar permission error for zmq as some other people have had. Someone said I should install nodejs globally, I'm not sure how to install globally with conda, it does'nt provide flags for installing packages specifically global.

Here is where npm/node/nodejs was installed in conda and versions:  ```  root@jupyter:# which node  /opt/conda/bin/node  root@jupyter:# node --version  v8.9.3  root@jupyter:# which nodejs  /usr/bin/nodejs  root@jupyter:# nodejs --version  v4.2.6  root@jupyter:# which npm  /opt/conda/bin/npm  root@jupyter:# npm --version  5.5.1  ```    So I ended up installing nodejs and npm through apt-get  ```  sudo su  apt-get install nodejs-legacy npm  /usr/bin/npm install -g ijavascript  ijsinstall  ```    Now this is the versions and where they are installed  ```  root@jupyter:# which node  /usr/bin/node  v4.2.6  root@jupyter:# node --version  v4.2.6  root@jupyter:# which nodejs  /usr/bin/nodejs  root@jupyter:# nodejs --version  root@jupyter:# which npm  /usr/bin/npm  root@jupyter:# npm --version  3.5.2  ```  Running ijsinstall, then the kernel is installed into /root, so I had to cd into /root/.local/share/jupyter/kernels  and then execute  jupyter kernelspec install dir  i.e. `jupyter kernelspec install javascript`    and this install method worked!  But starting a notebook I am getting an error on line 190 in /usr/local/lib/node_modules/ijavascript/lib/kernel.js    This is the debug log from /var/log/jupyterhub/jupyterhub.log:  ```  [I 2018-02-12 15:02:28.302 SingleUserNotebookApp restarter:103] KernelRestarter: restarting kernel (2/5)  KERNEL: ARGV: [ '/usr/bin/nodejs',    '/usr/local/bin/ijskernel',    '--hide-undefined',    '-h',    '/home/sigurdur/.local/share/jupyter/runtime/kernel-9c5bff57-ed88-4b3d-aa3f-ab593feda4a3.json',    '--protocol=5.0' ]  Usage: node kernel.js [--debug] [--hide-undefined] [--protocol=Major[.minor[.patch]]] [--session-working-dir=path] [--show-undefined] [--startup-script=path] connection_file  /usr/local/lib/node_modules/ijavascript/lib/kernel.js:190    ```    Here is that code.

But I would like to know if this is a real issue with the arguments(see the debug log) or if this should maybe be fixed in the repo."

__label__question "Variation on the 2FA locked out of wallet question Hi guys, I would be very grateful if you could point me in the right direction on this!    After going travelling and not opening my electrum wallet for many months, and losing my old phone (and therefore google authenticator app) I was unable to send any bitcoins on return.    I read that I had to restore the old wallet using my seed to disable 2FA. However, when doing so, I tried to restore a standard wallet by accident, instead of a 2FA. This created a new wallet with a tiny amount of bitcoins with odd looking transaction amounts. My full wallet remained unchanged. (see image)    When I then try and restore using the 2FA option, and type in my seed, it says ""old seed"". I am only given the option to extend it with custom words.    If I try to restore as a default wallet, it also says old seed. I am only offered the option to try the seed as a BIP39, but this only creates a totally empty wallet. Having done a bit of research, the words in my seed seem to pre-date BIP39. I have been upgrading electrum since around 2013.    When trying to restore as a multi-sig wallet, I also have to enable BIP39 such that the next button is un-greyed. If I follow this course, it gives me a master public key and asks for a cosigner key or seed. I have tried entering a master private key from looking at my wallet.dat file which was unsuccesful.    When attempting to restore by sweeping private keys saved from my full bitcoin wallet, this only brings up an ""electrum 3.0.6 has stopped working"" error over the please wait window.    I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling electrum to no avail.    I messaged trustedcoin but they haven't responded as of yet.    Is there any way I can get access to my btc?    Was there an automatic switch to 2FA that I have forgotten about?    Will trying to import the keys on the bitcoin core client / completely different PC make any difference?    WIll trying to sweep the keys / restore seed on an older version of electrum be risky?    Hope that isn't too long winded, I tried to be as concise as possible, am very new to the technicalities of it all!  ![electrum values](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36374581/36075619-674c785a-0f49-11e8-8a99-87d7417e416b.jpg)  "

__label__question "Forward Kinematics Improvements I have a few kinematics questions.  I don't claim to understand all of this math very well, so any guidance would be appreciated.    First, I noticed an oddity that I don't know if I caused or if this has always been there.  If when set to quadrilateral kinematics I     1. set the left chain to 0 and the right chain to 1650, and $K (recompute kinematics) I get an error (unable to find sled position).  2. set the left chain to 1650 and rerun $K. I still get an error.  3. restart GC and the sled position is properly calculated.    I chased this down and the issue is that Phi eventually becomes nan and this is only reset on a complete restart.  Adding the initial declared value of Phi = -0.2 to recomputeKinematics fixes the issue.  Has this been an oversight?  What does Phi represent?  Will resetting it cause an issue?    Second, I thought it would be nice to not have to call $K anymore and to update the kinematics whenever a relevant setting is changed.  The issue is that forward kinematics can take up to 6 seconds to fail out and with ~6 settings that affect kinematics this sucks a bit.    I added in an additional threshold in forward, if the guessed chain length exceeds the 11 foot chain length then the forward calculation ends early.  This is about a 10x savings in time, and means that forward fails in about 700 milliseconds (much more reasonable).  The calculations seems to work fine in all other respects.    I would make the chain length a user setting so that it isn't hardcoded at 11 feet.  Does anyone see any issues with this approach?  In watching the forward calculations I didn't see any instances where the guessed chain length gets larger than the allowed length only to turn around and become smaller again.    "

__label__question "[Suggestion] Method to match Muuri internal state to DOM state  I'm writing a library to bridge Muuri and Vue 2.x.  Since Vue is reactive, I'm running into problems when the parent component alters the prop that it's sending to my Muuri component.    As an example, here's some dummy code and a simple explanation of a problem I'm facing:    ```html  <div class='v-muuri-grid>    <div class='v-muuri-item' v-for='item in list'>      <div class='v-muuri-item-content'>        {{ item.name }}      </div>    </div>  </div>  ```  If you're unfamiliar with Vue, this will create one `v-muuri-item` for each element of `list`.  However, since Vue will change the elements of this list reactively, It's very hard to keep Vue and Muuri in sync.    **Scenario:**  1. `list` contains `['a', 'b', 'c']`.  This is passed to Vue, creating a DOM element for each item  2. Using Muuri, I drag item `'c'` to the 0th index  3. Listening to `grid.on('move')`, I then update `list` so its structure matches the DOM structure (`list` is now `['c', 'a', 'b']`)  4. Due to reactivity, this causes a re-render, changing the display names of the items.  _However_, since the Muuri representation of these items doesn't update when the DOM does, the display names become `'a'`, `'b'`, and `'c'` again, leaving `list` out of sync with Muuri.    [Here's a video](https://media.giphy.com/media/xUNd9VeeQTNGweUu5O/giphy.gif  ) of this happening.  Notice that the box labels change to the wrong label when the Vue state changes.    ___    Now, this one issue isn't hard for me to fix.  But handling the reactivity when an array is added to, deleted from, or replaced is pretty convoluted.    My suggestion is a method that reevaluates Muuri's internal state based on the current DOM.  Kind of like `synchronize`, but in reverse.    Thank you for this great library!  "

I once saw a documentary which calculated that nuclear was close to gas plants (which is 490 in your data). Nuclear can be a very religious subject but if you are ready to hear some experts on the subject, I can recommend some people / sources.    For example, uranium mining is a very carbon intensive activity so is uranium enrichment (not talking about health impact on locals). Also, if decommissioning  emissions were included, emissions would sky rocket.    Finally, the cost of an accident - not talking about money or people life and health - is very carbon intensive.

Now for how I know that it's not doing me right.  From my local docker (running under boot2docker on a mac), I can do:  ``` $ docker login mysubdomain.mydomain.com:5000 User: someuser Password: somepassword Email: WARNING: login credentials saved in /Users/waynew/.docker/config.json Login Succeeded $ docker pull busybox $ docker tag busybox mysubdomain.mydomain.com:5000/busybox $ docker push mysubdomain.mydomain.com:5000/busybox # docker does its push thing $ docker exec -it example_testminion_1 bash root@testminion# docker -H docker:2375 mysubdomain.mydomain.com:5000 User: someuser Password: somepassword Email: WARNING: login credentials saved in /root/.docker/config.json Login Succeeded root@testminion# docker -H docker:2375 pull mysubdomain.mydomain.com:5000/busybox ```  And everything is A-OK. However, if **instead** of doing the exec bash/enter thing, I simply run `state.highstate`... there is sadness :sob:   ``` testminion:     The minion function caused an exception: Traceback (most recent call last):       File ""/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/minion.py"", line 1036, in _thread_return         return_data = func(*args, **kwargs)       File ""/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/modules/dockerng.py"", line 3602, in pull         response = _image_wrapper('pull', repo_name, **kwargs)       File ""/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/modules/dockerng.py"", line 569, in wrapper         return wrapped(*args, **salt.utils.clean_kwargs(**kwargs))       File ""/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/modules/dockerng.py"", line 872, in _image_wrapper         registry=registry)       File ""/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/docker/api/daemon.py"", line 71, in login         return self._result(response, json=True)       File ""/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/docker/client.py"", line 146, in _result         self._raise_for_status(response)       File ""/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/docker/client.py"", line 142, in _raise_for_status         raise errors.APIError(e, response, explanation=explanation)     APIError: 500 Server Error: Internal Server Error (""invalid registry endpoint https://mysubdomain.mydomain.com:5000/v0/: unable to ping registry endpoint https://mysubdomain.mydomain.com:5000/v0/     v2 ping attempt failed with error: Get https://mysubdomain.mydomain.com:5000/v2/: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority      v1 ping attempt failed with error: Get https://mysubdomain.mydomain.com:5000/v1/_ping: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority.

__label__question "How to know when an actor is available. Suppose we create a handful of actors, assign a task to each, and want to assign a new task to an actor whenever that actor becomes available. `ray.wait` allows us to know when an ""object"" is available, but what we really want is an easy mapping from the object ID to the actor object.    Some options:    1. If the actors are stored in a list, then pass the actor's index in the list into the actor constructor and return it from the relevant method.  2. Maintain a dictionary mapping object ID to actor.    Note that in a lot of these situations, the actors are considered interchangeable for the purposes of the application, so this might be addressed by creating ""stateless"" actors whose identities don't matter and where multiple replicas of the actor are hidden behind a single object that we call methods on."

__label__question "No pull requests accepted in 2 months - is project still live? Electron.NET is an incredibly exciting project. As expected for an alpha- or pre-alpha project, it has serious and entirely expected new-project teething pains. Electron.NET is a cross-platform toolkit that doesn't yet work across platforms, it's a developer tool that doesn't yet work in debug mode, and it has a large and rapidly growing community of developers rallying around it and trying to use it.    But it has not accepted a PR in over two months. These aren't complex and subtle PR's that require tens of maintainer hours just to assess that are waiting to be accepted. These are minor tweaks to Readme's.    I've been [a huge fan of Electron.NET](https://github.com/yoDon/Electron.NET-React-Typescript-MobX), I remain a huge fan of Electron.NET, but if the maintainers refuse to accept PR's or can't invest the time to accept even the most trivial of PR's, we need to ask is this project still live?    I don't want to do this, but I have to start porting the projects I started on Electron.NET away from Electron.NET. That makes me profoundly sad. Electron.NET is a brilliant project. It is how I want to develop my applications. But there is no point in me or anyone else trying to fix the issues Electron.NET faces if no PR's are being accepted and no maintainer commits are happening either.    Two months with no PR accepts and no maintainer commits is a long time. Too long. Spending time tagging issues as ""bug"" or ""feature"" and ""assigning"" maintainers to them doesn't fix issues and isn't a solution to anything.    Is this project still live?    Is there a plan in place to allow it to succeed?  "

__label__question "General questions about how functions are  scaled Hi, Community,    Hope this is the right place to ask this kind of questions. I'm trying to understand how Azure Functions are scaled.  Base on https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-scale, ""Azure Functions uses a component called the scale controller to monitor the rate of events and determine whether to scale out or scale in. The scale controller uses heuristics for each trigger type. For example, when you're using an Azure Queue storage trigger, it scales based on the queue length and the age of the oldest queue message."" So which part of the source code of Azure-WebJobs-Script is ""scale controller""? I see [src/WebJobs.Script/](https://github.com/Azure/azure-webjobs-sdk-script/tree/dev/src/WebJobs.Script), but I did not see the monitor there."

__label__question "Explicit comparisons for strings are a bad practice because they don't account for null/undefined. For strings, the guide states:    > 15.3 Use shortcuts for booleans, but explicit comparisons for strings and numbers.  > ```  > // bad  > if (name) {  >   // ...  > }  >   > // good  > if (name !== '') {  >   // ...  > }  > ```    However, this is actually a bad practice for strings because it doesn't account for other falsey values like `undefined` or `null`. The developer may not always control the initial state of a variable if it's loaded from an API, so using explicit checks against empty strings is likely to result in subtle bugs in your code. To truly be safe, you'd have to do `if (name !== undefined && name !== null && name !== '') {`, which is pretty terrible.    For most things, you only care about ""do I have a value"". For this, the ""bad"" check is actually the most elegant and safe way to do this.    ```  if (name) {  ```    On StackOverflow, the ""bad"" answer has by far the most votes as well: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/154059/how-do-you-check-for-an-empty-string-in-javascript/154068#154068     Would you guys consider changing this?"

__label__question "Create a WaypointTrajector class Currently both the `Spline` class and the `Interpolated` class have a few methods for ""waypoints"", which are `getNumWaypoints()`, `getWaypoint(i)` and `getWaypointTime(i)`, which are not inherited from the base class `Trajectory`.  Those methods are mostly called in converting to some implicit path format, for example `DynamicPath` in `computeParabolicTiming()`.     @brianhou  suggested creating an abstract class `WaypointTrajectory` (in between base class `Trajectory` and `Interpolated` \ `Spline`) and defining all the ""waypoints"" operations in this class.  The change will merge conversions based on ""waypoints"" from both `Interpolated` and `Spline` into a single method, which will remove duplicate code.    A very minor concern is that whether it is fair to consider `Spline` as a `WaypointTrajectory`.  Because `Spline` is a sequence of line segments.   The ""waypoints"" of a `Spline` is ""indirectly"" obtained from segments.  https://github.com/personalrobotics/aikido/blob/master/src/trajectory/Spline.cpp#L206  https://github.com/personalrobotics/aikido/blob/master/src/trajectory/Spline.cpp#L226    We would like to hear some comments before making the change."

__label__question "Need a little help understanding koajs behaviour. Why does a koa server respond synchronously to two simultaneous requests from the same browser? So I am just to trying to write a hello-world server with koa and koa-router. This is my code.          const Koa = require('koa')      const Router = require('koa-router')            const timeout = (ms) => new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, ms))      const timestamp = () => {          const d = new Date()          return `${d.getUTCMinutes()}:${d.getUTCSeconds()}`      }      let req = 0            const app = new Koa()            app.use(async (ctx, next) => {          ctx.state.req = req          console.log(`URL: ${ctx.url}  time: ${timestamp()} request: ${req++}`)          await next()          console.log(`Hit req: ${ctx.state.req}! time: ${timestamp()}`)      })            const router = new Router()            router.get('/', async (ctx, next) => {          ctx.body = {              message: ""Hello, World!""          }          await next()      })            router.get('/favicon.ico', async ctx => ctx )            router.get(""/test"", async ctx => ctx.body = ""Just a test"")            app.use(router.routes())      app.use(async ctx => {          await timeout(10000)          ctx.body.message += ""After the delay!""      })                  app.listen(3000)      console.log(`Listening on port 3000`)      Now this is working perfectly for a single request from a single browser. Problem arises when I try to make a second request to `localhost:3000` from the same browser. The second request doesn't get registered (handled?) until the first request has been completed. This doesn't happen if I make a request to `/test` or use another browser to make the request. The behaviour is consistent for both Chrome and Firefox. Only exception is Firefox Quantum.         Listening on port 3000      URL: /  time: 47:5 request: 0      URL: /  time: 47:7 request: 1      Hit req: 0! time: 47:15      Hit req: 1! time: 47:17      URL: /  time: 47:21 request: 2      Hit req: 2! time: 47:31      URL: /  time: 47:31 request: 3      Hit req: 3! time: 47:41      URL: /  time: 58:14 request: 4      Hit req: 4! time: 58:24      URL: /  time: 58:47 request: 5      URL: /  time: 58:50 request: 6      Hit req: 5! time: 58:57      Hit req: 6! time: 59:0    Here request 0 and 1 are from two different browsers. As you can see, request 1, irrespective of request 0's status. Request 2 and 3 are made from same browser (either Chrome, Firefox or Opera, its same for each of them). Here request 3 only gets registered after the server has finished responding to request 2. Request 4 was an isolated request. Request 5 and 6 are from Firefox Quantum and it behaves as expected.    As per the answer to the [same question on stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48568684/need-a-little-help-understanding-node-js-behavior-why-does-a-koa-server-respond), this is happening since I am using `await` in my code. In that case, is this the intended behaviour? Shouldn't koa still respond to the second request irrespective of the first one?  "

__label__question "Extending Fields: rendering field's template without React I'm looking at the [carbon-field-number](https://github.com/htmlburger/carbon-field-number) example. The PHP part is clear to me, but I'm confused a little about the JS part.    I see that you use React to render the field's template. But what If I wanted to use a different JS library: Vue.js, Angular... or even plain JS?    I don't really understand based on what the PHP code ""guess"" what JS code is responsible for rendering a field... or the opposite: How the JS script ""knows"" where to render?     I didn't find any information in the [JS API documentation](https://carbonfields.net/docs/advanced-topics-javascript-api/?crb_version=2-1-0) how to wire up the JS code to a specific Field. I guess that a JS module must expose some public API and/or there must be some naming convention that I have to use in order to ""tell"" PHP that ""this JS module is responsible for rendering this carbon field"".    ---  **// edit**    I found that the [bootstrap.js](https://github.com/htmlburger/carbon-field-number/blob/master/assets/js/bootstrap.js) is the entry point and it imports the `registerFieldComponent` from `lib/registry`. But what the `lib/registry` module is? I can't find such a module either in the `package.json` nor in the repository.    ...I must have missed something that's really trivial.    **// edit 2**  OK. It seems more clear now when I found this line in the Webpack config:    ``` javascript  /**   * This path assumes that Carbon Fields and the current template   * are both in the `/plugins` directory. Change if according to your needs.   */  const root = path.resolve(__dirname, '../carbon-fields');  ```    the `registerFieldComponent` is meant to be loaded from the carbon fields plugin directory and it seems that we're forced to use React because the `registerFieldComponent` depends on React.

An alternative is having both `includeStartpoint` and `includeEndpoint` like in `VanDerCorput` class.    (2) The test for iterator is not fully covered.  There was only `StepSequence seq(0.3, true)` and `StepSequence seq(0.2, false)` is added recently.  The current code will still fail in `StepSequence seq(0.3, false)`.

__label__question "What are Individuals and Lindies all about? In [obtheory.txt](https://github.com/orcmid/miser/blob/master/oMiser/obtheory.txt), all obs, *x*, such that ob.a(*x*) = ob.b(*x*) = *x* are classed as individuals.  `ob.NIL` is established as such an ob, and it is indicated that there can be any number of additional distinct ones.  At the theory, these are distinguished by difference in the lexical forms of the names given to them.      In [obaptheory.txt](https://github.com/orcmid/miser/blob/master/oMiser/obaptheory.txt), as part of introducing universal functions obap.ap(*p*,*x*) and obap.ev(*exp*), a number of additional individuals  are introduced.  I.e., individuals such as `obap.A`, `obap.C`, `obap.SELF`, and `obap.EV` are identified as distinct primitives along with `ob.NIL`.  In the [reference notation](https://github.com/orcmid/miser/blob/master/oMiser/ob.txt) for expression of obs in plaintext, these are designated as `.A`, `.C`, `.SELF`, `.EV`, and `.NIL`, respectively.      Also, in [obaptheory.txt](https://github.com/orcmid/miser/blob/master/oMiser/obaptheory.txt), we learn that there are lindies (short for literal individuals) that are distinct from primitives and symbolized in the theory by notation Ʃ*s* where *s* is a distinct alphanumeric spelling taken as the identifier of the lindy.  In the reference notation, that lindy is simply written *s*.    Then, in the formulation of the universal function obap.ap in the theory language, *Ot*, there are some elaborate predicates concerning lindies.    What's this all about?"
__label__question "Modified default behavior for negative flux values in spectrum This is an issue just for discussion purposes.    When reading spectra from files, SMHR currently makes all negative values into nan.  For spectra with low S/N, or previously-normalized spectra (e.g. dividing out flats), this removes a lot of pixels that have information but possible bad reductions.    Instead, I have changed this so that it just turns the ivar into a small number but keeps the flux value.

__label__question "Dictionary domainItem reference In FGDC each domain item has a value, definition, and *definition source*.  When I constructed the FGDC reader I did not import the definition source figuring that a single reference (citation) for the whole domain should be sufficient.  Now that I'm writing it back out, I wonder.    The FGDC standard requires a 'definition source' be specified for each enumerated domain item.  If we are strict to the standard we need something to fill the slot.  Looking at the example provided by Dennis I see all definition sources are the same - ""author defined"".      To meet the FGDC standard I could take the `domainReference` and repeat its title in each domain item definition source tag.  This would require FGDC users to create a domain reference that cited the actual author - not just say ""author defined""; but this limits each enumerated domain item to having the same definition  source.     Also, there is no domain level reference in FGDC to harvest by an FGDC reader should someone be making a round trip.  Not a problem if coming from the mdEditor.    Choices:   - [ ] add a domain item reference (citation) so each domain item definition can be separately cited.   - [ ] use the domain reference (citation) title for each domain item when writing FGDC   - [ ] the hybrid - add a domain item reference, make it optional, use the domain reference when the domain item reference is not provided.    - [x] and hybrid 2 - add a domain item reference, make it optional, write in ""author defined"" when the domain item reference is not provided.    - [ ] other ??"

__label__question "Question about ZenPhoto20 I have a few questions about ZenPhoto20.    Currently I use Gallery3 for some years. At that time, I switched from a pure HTML gallery to Gallery3 because I liked it the most. Back then, I also tested JoomGallery, Piwigo, Coppermine and Zenphoto.  What I did not like about Zenphoto was this ""on the fly"" image processing and the cache. It's more neatly designed in Gallery3. What I really need is the tag function. In addition, the URLs in Gallery3 can be tree-structured, without file extension. Unfortunately, Gallery3 went into hibernation a short time later.  I only made a few small core hacks. Mainly I've got the responsive theme working, but only for me, with many adjustments. And I think my photo gallery website is good to find and well visited.    For some days I test ZenPhoto again and come back to the difficulties. Mainly URL, ""on the fly"" and /cache.    I like it more like Gallery3.  /albums  /resize  /thumbs  (possibly for ZenPhoto: backend-thumbs)  And move all images with moving albums/images (in /albums, /resize, /thumbs, ...)    My questions to ZenPhoto20:    1. Does ZenPhoto20 use the ""on the fly"" function to create images?  2. Does ZenPhoto20 use the folder /cache to save the resize images and does ZenPhoto20 save all resize and thumbs in the same subfolder?  I like it more   3.

I've followed the conversation on #2810. In which the suggestion was to simply not use a ConcatenatingMediaSource. However, in my use case, the user can toggle whether they want to ""auto play"", and I always want to be able to show the ""next track"" button. This happens to be the same behavior as Youtube.    The only other way I think it could be accomplished, is if I could smoothly (without affecting playback) swap my DynamicConcatenatingMediaSource for a singular MediaSource, and still be able to show the ""next track"" button as enabled.

__label__question "Random ports and gossip Hello,    I have a question about random ports and gossip protocols. Let's say you use two containers A and B depending on one another and you have a client connecting to A. Using some sort of internal gossip protocol, A will tell the client that he should connect to B using an ip and a port. Problem, those ip and ports are the internal ones from A's point of view and the client will never be able to connect to B.    This sadly happens quite often (kafka+zookeeper, clusters of some sort...)    A more practical example with Kafka and zookeeper:    ```yaml  version: '2'  services:    zookeeper:      image: zookeeper:3.4.10      ports:        - ""2181""      environment:        ZOO_MY_ID: 1    kafka:      image: wurstmeister/kafka:0.10.2.0      depends_on:       - zookeeper      ports:        - ""9092""      environment:        KAFKA_ADVERTISED_HOST_NAME: 127.0.0.1        KAFKA_CREATE_TOPICS: ""testtopic1:1:1""        KAFKA_ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT: zookeeper      volumes:        - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock  ```    Here the client will connect to Kafka and will never be able to get the correct external port to reach zookeeper. It also happens with the redis cluster image grokzen/redis-cluster.    Basically, do you know a way to cope that situation, configuration wise ? And if not, do you thing there is something you could do within your plugin to solve the issue ?"

__label__question "Question: par_iter slower than shell version; threads not 100% busy If there's a better place to ask this please close and direct me there but this seems like it is a lack of Documentation or a bug.  It could simply be that Rayon's parallelism model is not the right one for my task.    My main problem is that `iter_par` seems to start up with NCPU threads (16) and then eventually  backs off to 3-4 at a time while the rest just sleep.  The same functionality in (quite complex) shell runs in 190 seconds, but 250 seconds in rust (--release).  The code being ran in parallel is _very expensive_ since it does a *fork+exec*.    I've tried `.with_max_len(1)` and other combinations like using `std::usize::MAX` but nothing seems to help.    What I was looking for was a way to have a shared work queue that keeps all threads busy, sending work to the next available thread rather than splitting the work up ""evenly"".  That already sounds like it's not what Rayon is intended for, but with the _work stealing_ feature I figured it should be a decent library for prototyping, but was surprised by the results.    ## Details    I'm also on day 3 of learning Rust.    Using rayon 1.0.0.    ```  let mut portvars: FnvHashMap<&String, FnvHashMap<String, String>> =      FnvHashMap::with_capacity_and_hasher(ports.len(), Default::default());  portvars.par_extend(ports.par_iter().with_max_len(1).map(|port|      (port, port_var_fetch(&config, port, &fetchvars))  ));  ```    Here `ports` is a `Vec<String>` with 26000 items.  I have 16 CPU.    `port_var_fetch` runs `make` to gather variables from _Makefiles_ (on FreeBSD `make -V` can be used for this, I'm not sure what the equivalent in `gmake` is).      ### port_var_fetch    I've listed the `port_var_fetch` in case its implementation is relevant.    This is the `fetchvars` variable that is passed in.  ```  let mut fetchvars = Vec::new();  fetchvars.push((""PKGNAME"", ""PKGNAME""));  fetchvars.push((""MAINTAINER"", ""MAINTAINER""));  fetchvars.push((""FLAVORS"", ""FLAVORS""));  fetchvars.push((""FLAVOR"", ""FLAVOR""));  fetchvars.push((""CATEGORIES"", ""CATEGORIES""));  fetchvars.push((""IGNORE"", ""IGNORE""));  fetchvars.push((""DEPEND_SPECIALS"", ""${_DEPEND_SPECIALS:C,^${PORTSDIR}/,,}""));  fetchvars.push((""SELECTED_OPTIONS"", ""SELECTED_OPTIONS:O""));  fetchvars.push((""LIB_DEPENDS"", ""LIB_DEPENDS""));  fetchvars.push((""RUN_DEPENDS"", ""RUN_DEPENDS""));  ```    ```  fn port_var_fetch(config: &HashMap<String, String>,                    port: &str, vars: &Vec<(&str, &str)>) -> FnvHashMap<String, String> {      let mut args = Vec::with_capacity(vars.len() * 2);      for var in vars {          args.push(""-V"");          args.push(var.1);      }      let results = pmake(&config, port, args);      let mut result: FnvHashMap<String, String> =          FnvHashMap::with_capacity_and_hasher(vars.len(), Default::default());      result.extend(vars.into_iter().zip(results.lines())          .map(|(var, value)| ((*var).0.into(), value.into())));      result  }    fn pmake(config: &HashMap<String, String>,           origin: &str, args: Vec<&str>) -> String {      make(&(config.get(""PORTSDIR"").unwrap().to_string() + ""/"" + origin), args)  }    fn make(dir: &str, args: Vec<&str>) -> String {      let mut cmd = Command::new(""/usr/bin/make"");      cmd.stdin(Stdio::inherit())          .stderr(Stdio::inherit())          .arg(""-C"").arg(dir)          .args(args);      let output = cmd.output().expect(""Make failed"");      String::from_utf8_lossy(&output.stdout).trim().to_string()  }  ```"

__label__question "How to use ChakraCore Debug API Hi.    Once the JsDiagStartDebugging call is  done with a certain callback, and a call to [JSRun](https://github.com/Microsoft/ChakraCore/wiki/JsRun) is in the process of the provided code, the provided callback is called with the event JsDiagDebugEventSourceCompile.  That's ok.  But the code provided to JSRun is always runned before taking into account any call to JsDiagSetBreakpoint, or JsDiagRequestAsyncBreak, even if these functions are called inside the callback, or called before JSRun.    And so I always end with the JsErrorDiagNotAtBreak error code.  Furthermore with more complex code, any ""echo"" in the JS code is done (and visible in the console) when the call to [JSRun](https://github.com/Microsoft/ChakraCore/wiki/JsRun) is completed.

__label__question "sphinx-apidoc question Subject: First time sphinx user, so have a basic question.    ### Question  I'm using sphinx for the first time for a small project I started: https://github.com/raybellwaves/cfanalytics    I was able to follow the readthedocs.org [get started page](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html).    I'm now trying to document and show the API.    I then tried  `sphinx-apidoc -o source/ ../cfanalytics`  which now lists:  ```  $ cd source  $ ls  cfanalytics.core.rst	cfanalytics.rst		cfanalytics.tests.rst	modules.rst  ```  But i'm now not sure what to do with these and how to include it my index.rst to show something on http://cfanalytics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#    I couldn't find much help online. The doc for [`sphinx-apidoc`](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/man/sphinx-apidoc.html) shows how to use it but I couldn't find any step-by-step tutorials which show what to do after typing the `sphinx-apidoc` command.    Edit: On closer inspection opening the file https://github.com/raybellwaves/cfanalytics/blob/master/docs/_build/html/py-modindex.html seems fine on my laptop. It may be something to do with readthedocs which i'm looking into (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48878411/readthedocs-build-failing-using-aiohttp)      ### Environment info  - OS: MacOS 10.13.3  - Python version:  3.6.4  - Sphinx version: 1.6.6 (I use python installed from anaconda and installed sphinx using `conda install -c anaconda sphinx`)    Cheers,  Ray  "

This is a known issue that was fixed in boost 1.62.    As far as I know the only known fix is to upgrade to boost 1.62 or higher.  The code all works fine.      The question is whether it is worth upgrading travis to 1.62 or higher to get rid of the warnings.  Costs are that 1.61 is the lowest boost version we support that compiles everything.  so we would loose the earliest supported platform if we upgrade.     "

The urls for many of these files are given by sourceURL in the module metadata -- presumably those should be used by the module for downloading so that the developers don't need to change urls in multiple places.  >   > As is, `prepInputs` circumvents `downloadData`. I understand it's doing more than simply downloading, but it's using an entirely different mechanism for the download part [`downloadFromWebDB`]. At the very least we can try to be consistent in where those to download mechanisms get their data.    As I see it there is a disconnect between these two download mechanisms. I feel they should both use the same mechanism for downloads to ensure that a user always gets the same result.  _Copied from original issue: PredictiveEcology/SpaDES.tools#16_"

I'm going to write down my opinions over the possible new features commented in the readme, just to get more opinnions :)    1. Create a way to run jobs across multiple servers. [...] --> _maybe different collections? so each server can handle its own? Would need to implement kind of a ""proxy"" in the API but seems better for performance, doesn't it?_  2. Create a way for the server to pause jobs if the CPU usage is high. Every little bit helps, right?  --> _i would implement this after 5, just to allow to run important jobs in any case_  3. Create a way to run jobs as a microservice. --> _maybe that would be another project that uses this package and adds a REST API?_  4. Create a way to repeat jobs. (Perhaps this should be another package?) --> _as there are many formats to represent schedules and repetitions, I would go with different packages, yep_ :+1:   5. Create a way to prioritize certain jobs --> _nothing to add here :)_  6. Add support for hooks --> _nothing to add here neither :)_  7. Add Jobs.delay() to delaying tasks --> _maybe a field in the job object? a Jobs.delay() to delay all jobs and a Jobs.delay(jobId), Jobs.delay(priorityLevel), ... also related to 5?_  8. Add support for setting manual timezones on jobs --> _using momentJS should be ""easy"", isn't it?_    bonus track:    9. Add a template you can use as UI in a project's admin are (control job queue, jobs and get execution logs) --> this would totally be another package :)  10. Add some basic functions like: `Jobs.isStarted()` and `Jobs.getStats()` or just a `Jobs.getStatus()` for getting if the queue is stopped/started and jobs pending/failed/succeeded/canceled/running. This would be related to 1 and 5.    I'm totally interested in 4 and quite interested in 7 and 8. Also in 9 and 10 logically. I can put some spare time in this too :)"

__label__question "Question about IDL classes and properties A member of the ARIA group sent me the following question...   @marcoscaceres do you have an opinion?         I am working on the ARIA attribute-reflection branch for Issue #691. I attempted to define the “Role” interface in IDL with a single “role” attribute. However, this is either an IDL error or it’s a ReSpec parsing bug that does not allow the interface name and attribute name to be the same. If you use the <dfn> elements as expected, there is a case-insensitive match, and ReSpec throws an error that you’re defining the interface or attribute twice.  ```  interface mixin Role {      attribute DOMString? role;  };  Element includes Role;  ```  If I change the interface name, it works. As it is now, the “RoleInterface” interface is painfully redundant, but ReSpec parses the IDL as expected.    ```  interface mixin RoleInterface {      attribute DOMString? role;  };  Element includes RoleInterface;  ```"

We want a loading spinner to show for a minimum of ~ 600ms to signify something is happening in the application, Currently a request takes ~ 200ms which is too short for a UI change to not look broken, but we cannot guarantee that it will always be that quick, so a loading spinner is necessary  Expected result: minimumTime: 1000 would say that a request that takes ~200ms will wait an additional ~800ms before response happens.

__label__question "Reduce subspace of iterative EOF routine EOF unit test is failing (at least for me).  In the end, I'm getting the message:  > ValueError: On entry to DLASCL parameter number 4 had an illegal value  and all my eigenvalues are zero.  Traced the issue to the size of the subspace used.  We solve for more eigenvalues than necessary, in the hopes that we'll be more well separated from the uncomputed eigenvalues (and thus, converge faster with the power method).  The formula used to compute the subspace is:  ``` python subspace = 2*num + 8 ```  which means, even for computing a single eigenvector in the test script we need to keep track of the top 10 eigenvectors, and solve 10x10 covariance matrices. Even worse is for the `EOF_guess` stage, where we concatenate two sets of eigenvectors together to solve for ""merged"" eigenvectors.  This doubles (quadruples?) the covariance to 20x20, which (for the test data) is pushing us beyond the capacity of lapack.  We're getting negative eigenvalues for some of the smaller components, which get translated to NaNs later on and ultimately screws up the entire solver.  The safest thing would be to set the subspace equal to the actual space we're interested in by default, and not pad it with extra entries that might not be numerically resolvable.  The trade-off is this could slow down convergence, though.  However, you could always pass an explicit `subspace` value directly to `EOF_iter` and speed things up when it's safe to do so.  Any thoughts on changing the default subspace?  Has this been an issue for anyone else? "

Of course we have a database with test data for our development environment. But (as it's usual in development) not 100% of the edge cases are covered in that database.    These cases would have been easily avoidable by having some kind of test framework that developers could adopt to actually test their database migrations.    **Possible Solution**  A possible solution would be a database e2e testing framework where developers could could configure:  1. An in-memory database and how the model looks like before the migration is executed  2. The `node-db-migrate` migration that needs to be executed  3. A `mocha.js` (https://mochajs.org/) file which will execute the JS tests    So the testing framework would check multiple scenarios (with the defined in-memory database) and then check the results with the mocha.js tests.    This issue is more an open discussion than really a feature request. I'm interest in opinions if `node-db-migrate` should cover such a testing framework."

__label__question "vapp property changing restarts the VM, can it work like a null provider? Hi there,    Regarding the new vapp features introduced in #303 , I want to ask if there   is any reason why it’s changes are tracked and require real changes?    Both coreos cloud-init  and the general cloud-init are bootstrapping tools.    They are not used to introduce changes in an ongoing manner.    However, terraform still allows newer resources by changing the count parameter.  What if, ones usecase is to introduce some improvements in new server’s ignition config,  but handle configuration management on old servers out of band (with respect to terraform)?    I think it might be the more appropriate default setting for vapp properties to not trigger changes. If not by default, maybe users can specify whether they would like changes in their vapp properties to trigger real changes on existing resources. Just throwing some ideas there.    I always like how the null provider deals with changes. I have to explicitly taint and apply them. In vapp changes as I see them applying currently, restarting the VM may not be good for maintaining quorums of etcd, consul or zookeeper clusters.

I tried this:   lib.contentElement.settings.tx_smsresponsiveimages.breakpoints = {0: {'cropVariant': 'default', 'media': '(min-width: 1000px)', 'srcset': '1000, 1200, 1400, 1600'}, 1: {'cropVariant': 'mobile', 'srcset': '400, 600, 800, 1000, 1200, 1400, 1600'}}  But it shows an error message.  So please can you write a short description, how to use the picture-tag?"

__label__question "gulp-watch plugin  Hello,    I can see that currently we use [`gulp-watch`](https://github.com/kraftvaerk/generator-rammevaerk/blob/master/app/templates/PACKAGE/_DEPENDENCIES.json#L36) to view the changes and perform the corresponding tasks. Are there any advantages to using this over [`gulp.watch`](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/API.md#gulpwatchglob--opts-tasks-or-gulpwatchglob--opts-cb)? It just looks like an unnecessary dependency, but maybe it has some benefits that I don't know about ...    Thanks"

__label__question "Clarify end-to-end story for heatmap-scatterplots I wanted to clarify the end-to-end user story, from experimental data coming in to Refinery, to starting a heatmap-scatterplot (and other visualizations down the line). Right now there's a little confusion about how to relate the columns of the CSV to the metadata.    @ngehlenborg : Can you say which of these is best? (I started with 4, but now think 1 is most likely to work. Or maybe 3.)    ## scheme 1: vis input is multiple two-column CSVs.    Instead of taking a single CSV as input, there are multiple CSVs, each with just two columns: IDs and values. The machinery to merge these is already in place, and since Refinery metadata is file-based, we'll be able to connect the two.    ## scheme 2: vis input is one multi-column CSV, metadata from refinery    Right now, metadata is per-file, and there's no necessary relationship between the columns of the csv and the metadata that Refinery knows about. Both would need to change... perhaps there's a preparatory workflow that would need to be run?    ## scheme 3: vis input is one multi-column CSV, metadata from separate file    This was the impression I got at the meeting with core... but it's not Refinery-ish: The metadata should be refinery-metadata, not simply another data file. On the other hand, the route forward here is more clear than it is for other scenarios.    ## scheme 4: vis input is one multi-column CSV, metadata from headers    I think this is where I was initially heading, but it doesn't match the data core currently provides, and it might make parsing harder. (ie, How do I know when I'm past the metadata rows/columns?)"

__label__question "MasterElement inconsistency: `general_shape_fcn` not implemented for Wedge, Pyramids etc The `general_shape_fcn` is only implemented for HEX in 3-D but not for other topologies. Instead there are `wedge_shape_fcn`, `pyr_shape_fcn` etc. This causes issues for overset in [overset assemble](https://github.com/NaluCFD/Nalu/blob/master/src/overset/AssembleOversetSolverConstaintAlgorithm.C#L175) when used with mixed topologies. I am able to work around this temporarily by the code snippet below (wedge for example).    ```  +  void general_shape_fcn(  +    const int npts,  +    const double *par_coord,  +    double* shape_fcn)  +  { wedge_shape_fcn(npts, par_coord, shape_fcn); }  +  ```    However, I am unsure of the reasons behind this. Was this just an oversight, or is there a specific reason why the code defines `wedge_shape_fcn` instead of overriding `general_shape_fcn`? "

__label__question "suggestions 1) add the sorting of websites via site url, not just the site title.  That way when you sort it all the imdb.com are next to one another, all of the youtube.com's are next to one another, etc.      2) add a X button to delete a webpage, this will make management a lot faster.  Not a submenu like right click, but an actual button that appears when hovering over.  or at the very least when you hold down a button like shift, or control, that way you can manage old tabs not needed MUCH faster.  This feature is in almost all the other tab manager programs, this would be a great addition.    3) allow the top utility area to follow when scrolling down.  Especially the search field.  that way you don't have to scroll all the way back up to modify your search parameters or interact with any other button currently at the top.    4)  allow apple-f (command-f) to populate the search field for real quick searching instead of scrolling to the top manually either via scroll wheel or clicking on the bar.  this would be lessened with the suggestion #3, but it still would be also more helpful and fluid if you added this feature.      5)  with the slowness of removing tabs no longer needed, either opening them in a tab then closing that tab (slow) or manually clicking on the small box, then scrolling to the top and clicking deleted checked (almost worse), one way that may allow for another smoother way to manage would be the ability to highlight them like you would in finder, with perhaps shift or command/control, forming the group of ones you don't want then you can delete them with the button.  Even at this point adding a right click menu item of ""remove all tabs selected?"" would be helpful so not needing to scroll to the top.  On top of this suggestion, a slightly different way to do this, would be to allow arrow scrolling up and down, and allowing space bar to check/uncheck the boxes, once again to allow faster managing.  we are wrangling tabs here, and that can get into the 100's of tabs, so anything that cuts down movements and seconds, helps heaps.      I would love to say, thank you for this addon.  it is great.  Fantastic way to manage.  I hope you will look into adding this to safari and firefox.  Especially safari, it does not have anything even remotely good enough.  Firefox has decent alternatives, but man safari is lacking, probably due to having to get official certificate via apple developer, but hey, just make it github and we can install in a round about way.  Please please add these ideas as well as make a safari counterpart.  This way of managing tabs is vastly superior to others at the moment.  "

__label__question "Dynamically requiring components / require.context Is there a way to dynamically require a component in an example?    My use case is building a gallery of all of our icons, which are all SVG files transformed into React components at load time using `svg-loader`.   We have a lot of icons, so I'd like to avoid having to manually require them for the gallery - it's also an extra build step that's easily forgotten when adding icons to our styleguide.    This works in examples, but requires manual work for each new icon:    ```jsx  const icons = {      iconA: require('./icons/IconA.svg'),      iconB: require('./icons/IconB.svg'),      //...,      iconZ: require('./icons/IconZ.svg')  }    <IconGallery icons={icons} />  ```    Downside is manually adding the icon + require to each example.  The following would be a small improvement, but doesn't seem possible unless I'm doing it wrong - I get an error message that `require with expressions is not supported`:    ```jsx  const iconNames = ['iconA', 'iconB', /* ... */ 'iconZ'];  const icons = iconNames.reduce((icons, name) => {      icons[name] = require('./icons/' + name + '.svg');      return icons;  }, {});    <IconGallery icons={icons} />  ```    If I were building this in straight webpack, I would do something like this -- and this would be my preference since icons can just be added by dropping them in the right folder without editing the styleguide.  But I get the error that `require.context is not a function`:    ```jsx  const iconsContext = require.context('./icons/', true, /svg$/);  const icons = iconsContext.keys().reduce( (icons, file) => {  	const SVG = iconContext(file).default;  	const label = file.slice(2, -4); // strip './' and '.svg'  	icons[label] = SVG;          return icons;  }, {});    <IconGallery icons={icons} />  ```    Given the error messages I'm getting, it seems this is not possible... but I thought I'd ask in case there's a feature or configuration I'm missing.  Alternatively, any pointers for where I could look if I wanted to try to try my hand at adding this?"
__label__question "Extend sample code to have a good counter example Hi Guys,    I have troubles with creating sample code that generates a good and clear counter example. In my previous post we came to the conclusion that possibly the sample was to short to generate a good counter example, by disabling the optimizations we were able to get it correct.    I have tried several ways to increase the sample code, but none gave me a correct counter example with the optimizations enabled. With your experience, what would be a good extension to the following code snippet to get a good counter example?    my complete code as sample:    `extern int nd(void);  extern void __VERIFIER_error(void) __attribute__((noreturn));  #define assert(X) if(!(X)){__VERIFIER_error();}    extern int ValidateFunc(void);  extern int ValidateVal(void);  extern int nd ();  #define N 10  int a[N];    int addafter(int x, int y) {    return x+y;  }    int display()  {     int x=addafter(1,1); int y=3;   if(ValidateFunc()==10) {     int t1 = x;     int t2 = y;     x = t1+ t2;     y = t1 + t2;    }     assert(y == 3);       return 0;  }    int main() {    if(ValidateVal())    {      display();    }      int i;    for (i=0;i<N;i++)    {      if (nd ())        a[i] = N;    }      return 0;  }`    with the current code I always get the following counter example:  `@0 = private constant [1 x i32] zeroinitializer  @1 = private global i32 0  @2 = private constant [1 x i32] zeroinitializer  @3 = private global i32 0`    Where the expected values are not there (zeroinitializer).

__label__question "Should we use shippable for testing? Well,  While dockerhub gives us the errors in building, it doesn't test the programs with real data. For that a CI would be nice and the only one that I've found really compatible with docker is  [shippable](https://app.shippable.com/).  With shippable we can define the image to pull and create a yml file (just like all CIs) with commands to run on it.  This means we can have an automatic build from github and have shippable download a dataset and run the container on it.  Furthermore, shippable can pull the git, build the image, run the test and, it the container pass, submit the built container to dockerhub.  The disadvantage of the latter is that shippable requires the Dockerfile to be in the root of the git repository. May be in the future they change it.  What do you think? Should we advise for the usage of shippable and the creation of datasets for testing?  /cc @BioDocker/contributors  "

__label__question "Custom Logger / No longer use bind Is there a way to inject a custom logger (server) into rollbar.js? If not, how would we best support this?    The problem with the current [logger.js](https://github.com/rollbar/rollbar.js/blob/master/src/server/logger.js) is that we can't inject into the console since it uses bind.    So the option for my use case is either (1) use `function (...args) { console.log(...args); }` (PR) or (2) somehow inject a custom logger (which could then do that).    Suggestions?    *Use Case:*  I need to capture all console output for automatic analysis in testing. With the current rollbar setup the generic catch all fails since it uses `bind`."

Now, I'm implementing a `RegistrationStore` and I'm getting confused by this method again.    - [InMemoryRegistrationStore#addObservation](https://github.com/eclipse/leshan/blob/master/leshan-server-cf/src/main/java/org/eclipse/leshan/server/californium/impl/InMemoryRegistrationStore.java#L207) is removing existing observations matching the registration id, the path, and not matching the current observation id, which means that we'll keep at most 1 observation. This is because at first californium add its observation and then this method is called, which is removing every observation but the current one.    - [RedisRegistrationStore#addObservation](https://github.com/eclipse/leshan/blob/master/leshan-server-cluster/src/main/java/org/eclipse/leshan/server/cluster/RedisRegistrationStore.java#L366) is using the same logic with the difference that it's never executed leading to not removing any observation, see:    ```java  List<Observation> removed = new ArrayList<>();  if (!removed.isEmpty()) {    ...  ```    The question is, what is this method really supposed to do? I'm thinking that it might be better to just do nothing and possibly removing the method to avoid confusion.    Thanks."

My understanding is Zuul can be used for it but I can't figure out the best way to do it.   Do we need to deploy the new version of the service using a different name in Eureka (e.g. ServiceX-V2) and have Zuul route the internal requests to that service?

__label__question "Bug detection: enter valgrind # meson script support    Unfortunately, meson does not support this:       `meson test -v -V`    `-V` would run the test scripts under `valgrind`, collecting a wealth of information, see below.    # shtests: main test script runner    Deep down the main shell test driver is a script called shtests.  It is located in src/cmd/ksh93/tests/shtests.    It accepts some parameters, only one of them is currently supported in the meson script: -v.    Being an explorer who goes to the bottom of things, I dug out this way to wake up more options to shtests.    # Pre-conditions   - valgrind must be available for your OS (good for Linux, macOS only up to 10.12)   - must explicitly set SHELL to the built ksh    # Steps to run valgrind-ed tests    So this is how I did it under Fedora:   - `dnf install valgrind`   - after `ninja -C build`; cd build   - SHELL=`pwd`/src/cmd/ksh93/ksh   - cd ../src/cmd/ksh93/tests   - $SHELL ./shtests -v -V    # Impact    It displays a lot of info.  Of course, this slows down the tests, I would say they are more than 10x - 20x slower, rough guess.    # Positive run    If the test runs without any valgrind issues, it displays the same lines as with `./shtests -v`:  ```log  test alias begins at 2017-12-27+19:11:58  test alias passed at 2017-12-27+19:12:03 [ 23 tests 0 errors ]  test alias(C.UTF-8) begins at 2017-12-27+19:12:03  test alias(C.UTF-8) passed at 2017-12-27+19:12:08 [ 23 tests 0 errors ]  test alias(shcomp) begins at 2017-12-27+19:12:08  test alias(shcomp) passed at 2017-12-27+19:12:13 [ 23 tests 0 errors ]  ```  # Sort of negative run    Here's an example for a chatty run, on `append`:    ```log  test append begins at 2017-12-27+19:12:13    	Invalid read of size 2  	    build/../src/cmd/ksh93/sh/nvtype.c:1361:nv_type  	    build/../src/cmd/ksh93/sh/name.c:612:sh_setlist  	    build/../src/cmd/ksh93/sh/xec.c:1148:sh_exec  	    build/../src/cmd/ksh93/sh/main.c:609:exfile  	    build/../src/cmd/ksh93/sh/main.c:378:sh_main  	    build/../src/cmd/ksh93/sh/pmain.c:43:main  	Address 0x5f2f898 is 24 bytes inside a block of size 66 free'd  	    /builddir/build/BUILD/valgrind-3.13.0/coregrind/m_replacemalloc/vg_replace_malloc.c:530:free  	    build/../src/cmd/ksh93/sh/name.c:1387:nv_delete  	    build/../src/cmd/ksh93/sh/array.c:592:array_putval  	    build/../src/cmd/ksh93/sh/nvdisc.c:152:nv_putv  	    build/../src/cmd/ksh93/sh/name.c:2658:_nv_unset  	    build/../src/cmd/ksh93/sh/name.c:570:sh_setlist  	    build/../src/cmd/ksh93/sh/xec.c:1148:sh_exec  	    build/../src/cmd/ksh93/sh/main.c:609:exfile  	    build/../src/cmd/ksh93/sh/main.c:378:sh_main  	    build/../src/cmd/ksh93/sh/pmain.c:43:main  	Block was alloc'd at  	    /builddir/build/BUILD/valgrind-3.13.0/coregrind/m_replacemalloc/vg_replace_malloc.c:711:calloc  	    build/../src/cmd/ksh93/sh/nvdisc.c:840:newnode  	    build/../src/cmd/ksh93/sh/nvdisc.c:1097:nv_search  	    build/../src/cmd/ksh93/sh/name.c:1227:nv_create  	    build/../src/cmd/ksh93/sh/name.c:1532:nv_open  	    build/../src/cmd/ksh93/sh/name.c:373:sh_setlist  	    build/../src/cmd/ksh93/sh/xec.c:1148:sh_exec  	    build/../src/cmd/ksh93/sh/main.c:609:exfile  	    build/../src/cmd/ksh93/sh/main.c:378:sh_main  	    build/../src/cmd/ksh93/sh/pmain.c:43:main    	Invalid read of size 8  	    build/../src/cmd/ksh93/sh/nvtype.c:1366:nv_type  	    build/../src/cmd/ksh93/sh/name.c:612:sh_setlist  	    build/../src/cmd/ksh93/sh/xec.c:1148:sh_exec  	    build/../src/cmd/ksh93/sh/main.c:609:exfile  	    build/../src/cmd/ksh93/sh/main.c:378:sh_main  	    build/../src/cmd/ksh93/sh/pmain.c:43:main  	Address 0x5f2f8a0 is 32 bytes inside a block of size 66 free'd  	    /builddir/build/BUILD/valgrind-3.13.0/coregrind/m_replacemalloc/vg_replace_malloc.c:530:free  	    build/../src/cmd/ksh93/sh/name.c:1387:nv_delete  	    build/../src/cmd/ksh93/sh/array.c:592:array_putval  	    build/../src/cmd/ksh93/sh/nvdisc.c:152:nv_putv  	    build/../src/cmd/ksh93/sh/name.c:2658:_nv_unset  	    build/../src/cmd/ksh93/sh/name.c:570:sh_setlist  	    build/../src/cmd/ksh93/sh/xec.c:1148:sh_exec  	    build/../src/cmd/ksh93/sh/main.c:609:exfile  	    build/../src/cmd/ksh93/sh/main.c:378:sh_main  	    build/../src/cmd/ksh93/sh/pmain.c:43:main  	Block was alloc'd at  	    /builddir/build/BUILD/valgrind-3.13.0/coregrind/m_replacemalloc/vg_replace_malloc.c:711:calloc  	    build/../src/cmd/ksh93/sh/nvdisc.c:840:newnode  	    build/../src/cmd/ksh93/sh/nvdisc.c:1097:nv_search  	    build/../src/cmd/ksh93/sh/name.c:1227:nv_create  	    build/../src/cmd/ksh93/sh/name.c:1532:nv_open  	    build/../src/cmd/ksh93/sh/name.c:373:sh_setlist  	    build/../src/cmd/ksh93/sh/xec.c:1148:sh_exec  	    build/../src/cmd/ksh93/sh/main.c:609:exfile  	    build/../src/cmd/ksh93/sh/main.c:378:sh_main  	    build/../src/cmd/ksh93/sh/pmain.c:43:main    	Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value(s)  	    /builddir/build/BUILD/valgrind-3.13.0/memcheck/../shared/vg_replace_strmem.c:1099:__memcmp_sse4_1  	    build/../src/cmd/ksh93/sh/name.c:217:nv_addnode  	    build/../src/cmd/ksh93/sh/name.c:1593:nv_open  	    build/../src/cmd/ksh93/sh/name.c:689:sh_setlist  	    build/../src/cmd/ksh93/sh/xec.c:1148:sh_exec  	    build/../src/cmd/ksh93/sh/main.c:609:exfile  	    build/../src/cmd/ksh93/sh/main.c:378:sh_main  	    build/../src/cmd/ksh93/sh/pmain.c:43:main    test append failed at 2017-12-27+19:12:17 with exit code 3 [ 19 tests 3 errors ]  ```    # Conclusion    If we run the tests under `valgrind`, many more will fail.  E.g. the test `append` - depicted above, has never failed for me, ever.  With `valgrind` turned on, it does fail.    So this means switching on `valgrind` is only meaningful when the code base has become much more stable and manageable.    In other words, now is not a good time to incorporated it.    I do hope though that it helps me spot the SIGABRT and SIGSEV under macOS 10.12.6.    It would be great if the meson script supported `valgrind` directly.  "

__label__question "Ch 19.3 - Docker container exits immediately after docker run I'm new to Docker so it's possible I missed something here. At 19.3, we're asked to start the Docker container on our local machine with this command:    ```  $ docker run --name microblog -d -p 8000:5000 --rm microblog:latest  ```    When I do that, it executes successfully and it outputs the long hexadecimal. Next up is:    ```  docker ps  ```  Which if I run seconds after the previous command, will give me the name of the container ID. However, if you wait 30 seconds, _docker ps_ is empty. Same thing happens at the next step, when we try to start the container with the environment variables loaded.     Some quick Googling has shown this happening to programs that either complete and exit the container or with commands that exit the shell when run in background mode. I didn't get the impression anything we've done to this point should be affecting that - can anyone replicate or explain what I've missed?    "

The framework would basically consists of  - A socket server which would allow you to communicate between the CLI and the Browser UI.  - Easily invoke methods (kind of how remote works in electron) of CLI from Web UI without worrying about handing socket messages and vice versa  - Inbuilt updater which would update the installed module  - Anything that would be useful?

I've installed and tested hansel & gretel on a few single contigs in my dataset. Everything is very clearly explained and easy to use- thank you!    I'm curious about whether your software can be applied to multiple contigs together, i.e. to determine haplotypes based on SNPs present across multiple contigs? Specifically, I'm interested in assigning haplotypes to a ""genome"" (or at least the closest approximation of one that we can obtain from metagenomic sequencing). I know that I _can_ do this but I want to be it wouldn't violate any assumptions etc. in gretel if I _did_?    Thanks!"

__label__question "setExact() not working if scheduled for >15mins Library version: 1.2.1  Device model number: Lenovo K50a40  Android version: 6.0    So my use case is such that every day at midnight I need to check for a flag and if it's true I gotta unset it. My job is scheduled (for midnight) only after user taps on a button, which sets the flag as well. Following is my code for the button click listener:  ```java  Calendar calendar = Calendar.getInstance();  long currentTs = calendar.getTimeInMillis();  Log.e(""TS"", ""Current Ts: ""+currentTs);  calendar.set(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY, 0);  calendar.set(Calendar.MINUTE, 0);  calendar.set(Calendar.SECOND, 0);  calendar.set(Calendar.MILLISECOND, 0);  calendar.add(Calendar.DATE, 1);  long midnightTs = calendar.getTimeInMillis();  Log.e(""TS"", ""Midnight Ts: ""+midnightTs);  long fifteenMinutesInTs = 900000;  if(midnightTs - currentTs < fifteenMinutesInTs){      Log.e(""TS"", ""Difference < 15 mins"");      /*If difference is less than 15 mins, we schedule a job to be executed in 15 mins time      This is a limitation explained here -      https://github.com/evernote/android-job/wiki/FAQ#why-cant-an-interval-be-smaller-than-15-minutes-for-periodic-jobs*/      AutoDayOutJob.scheduleExact(fifteenMinutesInTs);  } else {      Log.e(""TS"", ""Difference >= 15 mins"");      AutoDayOutJob.scheduleExact(midnightTs);  }  ```    Following is my `scheduleExact()` method in `AutoDayOutJob` class:  ```java  public static void scheduleExact(long scheduledTs) {      new JobRequest.Builder(AutoDayOutJob.TAG)              .setExact(scheduledTs)              .setUpdateCurrent(true)              .build()              .schedule();  }  ```    So what happens is if my timestamp is <15mins, it works perfectly. I tap on the button to schedule my job and then remove my app from recents and turn off the screen and when I check back after minutes I can see that the button has been unset (as a result of flag being unset when job was run). But when I set the timestamp to say 20 mins and perform the exact same procedure it doesn't work. The button remains set and the job is never executed.    **Note:** I tried using both `Job` and `DailyJob` classes and their respective methods but the result is the same.    I hope you understand my problem from what I've provided, if you need anything else please let me know. Thanks."

__label__question "Common questions about MAPI Hello Stephen,    because I never found a valid email address of you, I open a pseudo ticket/issue. Not nice, I know. But if you have a mail address for me, we can talk in future directly.    I work now a longer time with MAPI and several things become more and more clearly about time. But some things are not totally clearly for me and it is painful/hard to google those information.    -- First thing: ONLINE / OFFLINE Mode  I thought until now, the online mode is only a cached view. But I see, the structure has more differences as I thought. In online mode I have a property `PR_CONTAINER_CONTENTS`, `PR_CONTAINER_HIERARCHY`   and `PR_FOLDER_ASSOCIATED_CONTENTS`. In offline mode, not. Why? Is there a reason?  Are this 2 different providers? Is this the reason, why `GetProps `works with parameter `null `(to get all properties in online mode) works and in offline mode not? A first explicit call to `GetPropList()` is necessary, how I saw it in your code.  If I like to download all items, must I be necessary in ONLINE Mode? I thought missing items (i mean not yet in cache) would be in background automatically transfered/pulled. Next time, I get the cached item. But I see, I get only a minimal subset of all items in a new .ost (automatically created by MAPI via OpenMsgStore)    -- Second thing: Can I detect the configured offline/offline mode? (how user configered his connection to mailbox in outlook? non-cached, chached, if yes, the timeout)  Indirectly I can check the existance of properties above. But is this a good practise?  Outlook can show: there are more items, please click to load. Do you know how Outlook implements this feature. 2 MAPI Sessions, one offline, one online and compares the row count?    -- Third thing: Object types / `PR_OBJECT_TYPE` and named properties  It is possible to use this value for determinate the object and interface  (e.g. `IMAPIFolder`, `IMessage`), ok. Every of them are derived from `IMAPIProp`. `IMAPIProp` contains `GetNamesFromIDs()`. So every object could implement a different named property storage. Is this right? Or does every object use and access a global named property table? I see, you implement a cache in MFCMAPI, too.    Have a happy christmas, thanks.    Regards,  Michael"

I parsed geometries in my drawing -> I found circles with centers that seem to be in paper coordinates since the numbers change when I move the view before exporting to dxf :   Console.WriteLine(circ.ToString() + ""(.Owner= "" + circ.Owner + "") CX="" + circ.Center.X + "" CY="" +   circ.Center.Y);  Circle(.Owner= *Model_Space) CX=196,0103171922 CY=84,4324113898  Circle(.Owner= *Model_Space) CX=198,7291570945 CY=92,8001401971  Circle(.Owner= *Model_Space) CX=200,377803623 CY=101,44264796    I wanted to see the coordinates not in paper coordinates but in ""view"" or ""part"" coordinates.   The circles are owned by a block called *Model_Space which seems to have its origin at (0,0).   Console.WriteLine(""*************************************"");              Console.WriteLine(""blocks"");              foreach (netDxf.Blocks.Block block in dxfLoad.Blocks)              {                  Console.WriteLine(""Name="" + block.ToString());                  {                      Console.WriteLine(block.ToString() + "".Origin.X="" + block.Origin.X);                      Console.WriteLine(block.ToString() + "".Origin.Y="" + block.Origin.Y);                      Console.WriteLine(block.ToString() + "".Origin.Z="" + block.Origin.Z);                  }              }  *************************************  blocks  Name=*Model_Space  *Model_Space.Origin.X=0  *Model_Space.Origin.Y=0  *Model_Space.Origin.Z=0  Name=*Paper_Space  *Paper_Space.Origin.X=0  *Paper_Space.Origin.Y=0  *Paper_Space.Origin.Z=0  Name=*Paper_Space0  *Paper_Space0.Origin.X=0  *Paper_Space0.Origin.Y=0  *Paper_Space0.Origin.Z=0  Name=SW_CENTERMARKSYMBOL_0  SW_CENTERMARKSYMBOL_0.Origin.X=0  SW_CENTERMARKSYMBOL_0.Origin.Y=0  SW_CENTERMARKSYMBOL_0.Origin.Z=0  *************************************    If I subtract the Origin of the one and only Insert in the drawing I don't get correct values either.

__label__question "Honeypot suppresses registration of new users in my browser Because of whatever in the registration form or processing I can not register as a new user in my own forum. I get an error message ""Not all fields have been filled out"" even I filled out every visible (`new_user_name`, `new_user_email`, `reg_pw` and `reg_pw_conf`) and leaved empty every honeypot field (`phone` and `repeat_email`). Surprisingly the honeypot field `repeat_email` gets the value of the admin accounts user name after sendig the form for the first time. This could be a browser issue.    The check for not filled fields in [line 59 of the `register.inc.php`](https://github.com/ilosuna/mylittleforum/blob/4354f5b6510321867b20e07e44e0ba115fc8ee4b/includes/register.inc.php#L59) seems to be broken. Is it correct to fail with an error in case of `!isset($_POST['repeat_email'])` or `!isset($_POST['phone'])`? My understanding of the honeypot is to leave the fields empty and not to make them mandatory."
__label__question "Is ""-U"" available in local mode? https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-libev/blob/master/README.md :  > [-U]  nable UDP relay and disable TCP relay,  > not available in local mode    https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-libev/blob/master/doc/ss-local.asciidoc :  > -U Enable UDP relay and disable TCP relay.    So is ""-U"" available in local mode or not. And if it is available, how it works? As I know, ss-local works as socks5 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1928) and if client want to send udp packet through socks5 server, it must to send udp assoc request on 1080 tcp port, but if I run ss-local with -U option it binds only 1080 udp port (SS 3.1.1)."

__label__question "Regarding ""Slide Launcher Pro"" (followup from a discussion on #369)    **tl;dr**: There is an app selling a modified KISS version on the Play Store. KISS is GPL. They claim they published it while it was still MIT. But they have new features. Anyone with legal knowledge on the topic?    -----    Play Store link: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.plh.note7slide    Since KISS licence is GPL, I sent this first email:    ```  Hi,    I'm Neamar on Github, owner of the https://github.com/Neamar/KISS/ repository on which Slide Launcher is based.    Kiss licence is GNU/GPL v3.    Although you're more than welcome to create your own fork of the project and add features, you also need to comply with the project's original licence at https://github.com/Neamar/KISS/blob/master/LICENSE    You're allowed to sell the project if you want to, but in your case, you also need to:    * Open source the changes you built on top of KISS (grid view, etc.)  * Ensure that you mention the original project is KISS. A link in your Play Store description should be enough.    Thanks for your attention, congrats on your changes -- looking forward to seeing them online :)  ```    After this email, the description for the PRO version (not the standard one) was updated to mention ""Neamar/Kiss"" in text (no link). The lite version doesn't mention anything, but in the app, settings, legal, you can see ""© Matthieu Bacconnier 2015"" -- that's my name, but I never had any © on KISS.    I had no reply to my email, but @eevleevs contacted them, saw they didn't want to change anything and reminded me of the problem. So I sent another email:    ```  Hello again,    I noticed that you changed the description in the Store, thanks. I'd appreciate if you could make it a link, either to the Play Store or Github.    However, you haven't open-sourced your changes, which is the second requirement from the GPL licence.    It also looks like in discussions with other persons, you failed to mention you had already been asked to publish the source code.    Please do it before next Friday (that will give you a month of notice since my first email), since respecting the license will mean a better ecosystem for everyone's app -- plus, as you make money out of the app, it's only fair that you comply with the legal requirements.    Thanks for your attention again. Hopefully, I won't have to send another mail next week...  ```    This time, I got an answer, asking me ""how to open-source"", and claiming that Slide Launcher was on the Store while KISS was still MIT (July 3rd, 2016 https://github.com/Neamar/KISS/commit/1443adc77a89d4ec5dde3e0378d0da06b626b682).    A quick look at the app, which is very similar to KISS indeed, let me think they've incorporated features published in KISS since then (color change at least), and from my understanding of GPL the licence is sticky which means that by pulling part of the code they agree to publish all of the code.    Anyone here with some legal knowledge on the matter? Would like to double check I'm correct before asking for Play Store arbitration."

__label__question "SMTP credential charset/encoding, what is ""correct""? Hi Jeff,    today I got a problem authenticating against an MS-Exchange SMTP service.  The username contains a german umlaut which is by default UTF-8/BASE64 encoded by MailKit.  It seems that Exchange only accepts ISO-8859-1/BASE64 encoded usernames.    I found an encoding argument in the .Authenticate() method, so I can set this up.  But what is the ""correct"" approach to do this?  I've never seen a mailclient where I have to configure the encoding to be used for login.  So I think the client must have a way to determine the correct one on its own.    Because MailKit uses UTF-8 as default, I think this is the recommended one, right?  I had some problems fetching this information from the RFCs for my own...  Maybe you can help me out?

I recently ran into a problem where I needed to recover some 3D assets that no longer have its originals so I thought hey I know the data format of these resource files maybe i should just rebuild the scene as an FBX.  So right now i'm trying your amazing FBX wrapper. But this project is not complete as I hoped it would be.     I have ran into a problem where I can't create many of the necessary nodes to build a scene.  Things like FbxNode.Create() and FbxScene.Create()  wouldn't allow me to pass it the FBXManager.   Many things missing for building a basic scene like FbxSurfacePhong and no ability to addMaterials to the nodes.  Essentially I only know how to build and export unpopulated empty scenes.  Export class works though.  I'm using the ExportDocument sample that came with the FBX 1015.1 SDK as a guide. I'm using VC 2012 with update 4.   I'm not very experienced with C/C++ so I'm at a loss.  Should I just give up if this is unattainable?

__label__question "Is there a trick to speeding up buffering? ### The issue    When the playback begins or when you seek to a position, there's a very noticeable lag of a few hundreds of milliseconds. After jumping through several stack overflow questions and github issues and blog posts and what not, apparently this is because ExoPlayer (or rather any video player) needs to build the seeked frame from the previous key frame.    My question is, how do popular video players such as [MX player](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mxtech.videoplayer.ad) have near instant playback on startup and on random seeks? What are they doing better than ExoPlayer? Is there a way to make ExoPlayer buffer faster?    This isn't a specific issue with some particular version or input file or codec or device, but exoplayer's performance on the whole seems a bit slower than the competition.    ### How to reproduce    Open a video in any popular android video players, e.g: MX Player, VLC etc. Now open the same file in a boilerplate surface (or `SimpleExoPlayerView`) backed by exoplayer.

__label__question "Publish the spec behind the Micrsoft Querystring Parsing and Serialization rules Could we get some light shed on the whys/hows of [querystring handling logic in vNext](https://github.com/aspnet/HttpAbstractions/blob/dev/src/Microsoft.AspNet.PipelineCore/Infrastructure/ParsingHelpers.cs#L558)? Previous [versions](http://referencesource.microsoft.com/#System.Web/xsp/system/Web/HttpValueCollection.cs#159) have been inconsistent at best, and this seems like a great chance to fix things.  An all-encompassing parsing strategy may be possible, but inadvisable, as the logic could not be clearly communicated to developers. I would suggest instead that parsing/serialization formats be named specifically for their appropriate use.   For example, requests with content-type `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` must follow the [WHATWG parsing/serialization spec](http://url.spec.whatwg.org/#application/x-www-form-urlencoded-0) &mdash; which differs from php, ruby, node, python, classic asp, and each implementation in asp.net vNow, most of which have differing rules on one or more points: 1. Handling of duplicate keys. (error, replace, concatenate, or build list)? 2. Hash serialization. `key[a]=1&key[b]=2` produces `key = {a=1, b=2}` in some implementations 3. [Array serialization](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6243051/how-to-pass-an-array-within-a-query-string). `a=1&a=2`, `a=1,2`, `a[]=1&a[]=2`, `a[1]=1`, a[2]=2` are all valid ways to represent an array value on different platforms.  4. Handling of invalid characters (error, or pretend they were URL encoded)? 5. Encoding of reserved characters (Most frameworks fail to url encode reserved characters correctly) 6. Order preservation - some developers (inadvisably) rely on the order of querystring pairs. A recent instance of this is in the latest version of Umbraco.  7. Case preservation and case sensitivity.  8. URL decoding pass count (AFAIK, only ASP.NET WebForms messes this up). Ideally,  `+`, `%20` -> ` ` should be the only lossy operation.   Once we know the team's opinions on querystrings (and paths - and PathInfos), I think there are a lot of developers that would be happy to pitch in with unit tests and compatibility profiles. I imagine that [Javascript/Node](https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/f7ede33f09187cd9b1874982e813380cd292ef17/lib/querystring.js#L142) and [php](https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/419d98b291b4dd36e63f34d72445bd954f3ce3e2/ext/standard/string.c#L4445) compatibility would be the highest priority.   Of course, this is easiest if we can ensure that we do not lose any data between the network packet and the developer. I'm looking at you, IIS. "

__label__question "[Question] How to implement grid layout like Instagram's photo lists ## New issue checklist    - [x] I have reviewed the [`README`](https://github.com/Instagram/IGListKit/blob/master/README.md) and [documentation](http://instagram.github.io/IGListKit)  - [x] I have searched [existing issues](https://github.com/Instagram/IGListKit/issues) and this is not a duplicate    ### General information    - `IGListKit` version: 3.0  - iOS version(s): all    ### Question  I was able to implement a grid layout using `IGListGridCollectionViewLayout` (codes below) in version 2.2.0, but after updating it to version 3.0.0 I am not sure how I should implement the same feature since `IGListGridCollectionViewLayout` was replaced by `IGListCollectionViewLayout` which is not `UICollectionViewFlowLayout` and is restricted to inherit.    This is the layout I want to implement.  ![img_2263](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12425729/26140035/8a232f40-3b0f-11e7-8143-f9e82016d80b.PNG)    I was able to do the layout with the piece of code below, but in version 3.0.0 I can't do the same thing by using `UICollectionViewFlowLayout` instead of `IGListGridCollectionViewLayout`.    In `ViewController` inherited from `IGListAdapterDataSource`  ```swift      let layout: IGListGridCollectionViewLayout = {          let layout = IGListGridCollectionViewLayout()          layout.minimumInteritemSpacing = 1          layout.minimumLineSpacing = 1          return layout      }()        let collectionView = IGListCollectionView(frame: .zero, collectionViewLayout: layout)      view.addSubview(collectionView)      adapter.collectionView = collectionView  ```    In `SectionController`  ```swift       override init() {          super.init()          minimumInteritemSpacing = 1          minimumLineSpacing = 1      }        func sizeForItem(at index: Int) -> CGSize {          let rowCount = photo.rowCount          let containerWidth = collectionContext?.containerSize.width ?? 0          let width = (containerWidth - (minimumLineSpacing * rowCount)) / rowCount          return CGSize(width: width, height: width)      }  ```    It would be really great if someone from Instagram team tells me how you guys do that.

__label__question "distinguish/visualize the concepts of ""paths"" and ""links"" better There are two distinct kinds of ""objects"" that describe how different nodes are connected:    - The first kind we called ""paths"", as specified in the YMAL data files, provide the connections of among the four categories. Each path connects one node in each category.   - The second kind we called ""links"", which are generated from ""paths"", are the links between nodes that are in adjacent categories. For example, a link connects ""SIDM"" in Models and ""halo density profile"" in Probes.    Each ""path"" would exactly has N-1 ""links"", where N is the number of categories (currently N=4). Two different paths could share some links    Right now the visualization mostly focus on links rather than paths. Even in the network diagram view, the highlighted paths when mouseover are *all possible paths*, not just the paths we have entered in the YMAL file.     The question is how to better visualize the ""paths"" in the matrix view, and also how to distinguish *entered paths* from *all possible paths* in the network diagram view. This is not entirely trivial (both conceptually and technically) so I open this issue to solicit suggestions.  "

I am applying some tricky formatting using SVG colored bars in the table cells that worked well with printing DT::datatable() to PDF (and excludes more typical PDF table functions), but recently I'm seeing this extra text showing up at the top of the created intermediary PDF figure that gets embedded in the main tex document:    ```  --- title: datatables header-include: |- head: '' background-color: white ---  ```    BTW, this also shows up in the embedded PNG when knitting to `word_document`.    ## Reproducible Example    Here's a super simple reproducible example for an `test-dt.Rmd`:    ```yaml  ---  output: pdf_document  ---  ```    ```{r}  library(DT)  datatable(mtcars)  ```    ```{r}  devtools::session_info()  ```    When this gets knitted I see in the PDF:    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2837257/33901900-1c35e2a8-df28-11e7-81f0-a0b077e1933c.png)    ## Debugging    I can't tell if this extra text is coming from the `DT`, `rkmarkdown`, or `knitr` packages. Simply using the `keep_tex: true` is not helpful since the output PDF of the table is seperately generated as PDF and included in the main tex document.    ### Packages with Error    Here's my `session_info()` on a Mac using latest CRAN package updates that produces the erroneous text:    ```  ##

It looks like I can’t install SDK 2.6.210 on a cluster with SF Runtime Version 5.6.220… and there is no SDK 2.6.220 so It looks like i can't install SDK on that node.  to workaround this issue we had to Install SDK 2.6.210, remove 2.6.220 runtime and add the server as a new node to the cluster for it to work.  Is this by Design? Is it a bug? Do you know if SDK 5.6.220 is about to be released soon?  "

__label__question "Original version of alunar firmware Hello,    Sorry to contact you this way, but I didn't find a way to contact you except via issue submission...   You mention that this is the firmware that came with your alunar prusa i3.     I have recently purchased the alunar m508... I wanted to make some modifications to enable auto leveling, but the SD card that was delivered with the package is damaged and is unreadable. So, I don't have any baseline for the firmware (don't even know what version is actually installed). So, I'm afraid to flash anything if I can't get back to the original version in case of a problem...     So, I was wondering if the version you have here would work with the m508? I see you have already brought it up to the latest marlin version. Do you also have the original version delivered on the SD card (in fact, do you have the content of the original SD card)?  "

But we can get the ARP messages on the end hosts using tcpdump    ***    We tried to create a VLAN and add the two interfaces to this VLAN, and   ```  brctl show  ```  indicates that the two ports are indeed added to this VLAN, we also have them removed the interfaces from the other parts of configuration like ""INTERFACES"".

__label__question "Alternative Architectures I have been trying out GraphQL with my own projects recently. It seems to me that there are two approaches to a GraphQL API: 1. Monolithic GraphQL handler 2. GraphQL Backend for Front End  This project takes the monolithic approach, which is probably best for a boilerplate. It's easier to manage but it does have downsides. Like any monolith, as this grows it will be harder to manage the GraphQL handler and all the data the service owns. It also potentially violates the Principal of Least Access by having one handler access a wide set of data.  For those reasons, I think a [Backend for Frontend](http://samnewman.io/patterns/architectural/bff/) approach might be better long term. This is a diagram from the presentation I gave recently   <img width=""843"" alt=""screen shot 2016-10-16 at 7 35 38 am"" src=""https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1297227/19413533/2f429c12-9373-11e6-88a7-c40c6529919c.png"">  The idea is that the GraphQL API, User Service and Moisture Service can be three separate microservices. The advantages of this is that it adheres to the principal of least access and it increases cohesion and reduces coupling.  I don't think that this design should be used for the boilerplate. It's possibly too complex for people that just want to get started. But, it would be good to make people aware of this design so they understand their options.  What do you think? "
__label__question "Question: How does one refresh the secrets from VaultPropertySource manually?  I'm using the current version of spring-vault: 1.1.1.RELEASE  Having the following scenario:     I start up my java app with spring-vault having a configuration annotated with VaultPropertySource and the first Vault call manages to succeed. In the meanwhile, the secrets are changed (automatically or manually) and my app cannot use the old DB secrets to connect to the DB.     How can I trigger the refresh of the DB Secrets Configuration annotated with VaultPropertySource?     ----  Related problem:     I start up my app with spring-vault and the Vault container manages to start slower than my app. The app makes the call to the Vault through VaultPropertySource Configuration and it fails. This fails my entire container and app.     I haven't seen a retry mechanism option in the docs. Is there one or is it going to be implemented?

__label__question "Encryption warning I wanted to ask, when encrypting you get a popup along the lines of ""if you change your pattern you won't be able to decrypt""  What is this in reference to? I tried changing my phone lock and could decrypt just fine.  Also, I have seen on a bug that if you wipe Amaze you can no longer decrypt, possibly due to a database? Is that expected behaviour or a bug? It seems very dangerous that you wouldn't be able to decrypt on a different device or location, specially with the cloud plugin as I imagine one of the main reasons to encrypt a file is to put it on the cloud.  If that is the case I would like to suggest removing the need of the database completely, have the files extension determine if its been encrypted, (foo.aez is encrypted once, foo.aez.aez is an encryption of an encryption, etc) that way it would allow you to move encrypted files around safely"

__label__question "Advice on cross-domain localization Hello,  I have two websites and one is used as an IdentityServer, where user login to enter credentials or register and where he is redirected back to the second website after. Each website lives on a different domain but I can also target them to sub-domains of a main domain if that is a needed.    Localization is implemented successfully on each website with a dropdown button for the cultures.

__label__question "Buffering behavior and size? From the README:    >This is done by writing to a ""File"" interface which buffers the input so it can be read at any time from many independent readers.    I can see that a `bytes.Buffer` is used as the underlying buffer in memfs.go, and readers maintain their own offset into the buffer's byte slice and read from it directly.    This means `Read` is never called on the `bytes.Buffer`, essentially making it an unbounded buffer that contains all the data ever written to it. Is that accurate?"

However, I need to be sure that if Glide.clear(target) is called before the Future completes, that the image is not loaded.    Example:  1. `Future<GlideUrl> glideUrlFuture = getGlideUrl();`  2. `Glide.with(context).load(glideUrl).into(target) // load the url once the future completes`  3. `Glide.with(context).clear(target) // reset the target and cancel loading the image`    The happy execution order is 1, 2, then 3. The image is loaded and then the target is cleared.    The bad execution order 1, 3, then 2; the image is loaded after the target was cleared!

__label__question "Angular + Native script - model changes not reflected in the view _From @jacobkuriala on November 28, 2017 17:10_  I seem to be having a similar issue to #4311 . Not sure if I'm doing it right or if there is a bug. I have got a service that creates a web socket and creates and returns an observable. My component subscribes to the observable and changes the component data members when new data arrives. The data members get updated in the component (as observed through console.log) but the labels are not updated on the UI (whose text attribute are linked through property binding). If I move to a different tab and move back the latest data gets shown. I also tried both the change detection strategies.    P.S: I am using the angular tabbed template from sidekick as the initial template.  ```  import { Component, OnInit, OnDestroy, ChangeDetectionStrategy } from """";  import {MYService} from ""../../my.service.service"";  import { Subscription } from 'rxjs/Subscription';    @component({  selector: ""Home"",  moduleId: module.id,  templateUrl: ""./home.component.html"",  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.Default  })  export class HomeComponent implements OnInit,OnDestroy {  public prop1:number;  prop2:number;  prop3:number;  subscription: Subscription;  constructor(private myService: MYService ) { }    ngOnInit() {    this.createSocket();  }    createSocket(){   this.subscription = this.myService.startSubscription().subscribe(    (message)=>{      if(message.data){        let data = JSON.parse(message.data);        if(data.type === ""ticker""){          // console.dir(data);          if(data.product_id === ""a""){ this.prop1 = data.price; console.log(this.prop1); } // shows updated data in console          else if(data.product_id === ""b""){ this.prop2 = data.price; console.log(this.prop2); } // shows updated data in console          else if(data.product_id === ""c""){ this.prop3 = data.price; console.log(this.prop3);}        else{console.log(data);}        }      }    }    // on error and complete not implemented   );  }    unsubscribe(){    this.subscription.unsubscribe();    this.myService.stopSubscription();  }    ngOnDestroy(){    this.unsubscribe();  }  ```  _Copied from original issue: NativeScript/NativeScript#5100_"

__label__question "RFC: Do tasks and comments created from github need a github context? # Problem    As it is right now, task and comments which also exist on github should contain enough information for us to, for example, indicate this in the Ember app.     By that, I mean, we have enough information to show a simple indicator along the lines of ""this task/comment also exists in the associated github repo"".    For the task specifically, we also have enough information to render the associated github repo information i the task sidebar.    What we don't have is    - Enough information to show a link to the task/comment. We could possibly compute the information we have to build the link, but the Github API documentation emphasizes we should prefer to use the prebuilt links their endpoints provide.  - Enough information to know for sure that the task/comment *originates* from github, meaning, it was created there and was then synced to codecorps, not the other way around. In some cases, we could safely conclude that, but not in all cases.    This Issue should serve as a place to discuss these things.    The question is    - Would information like that be useful. The answer is probably yes, but then it's a matter of what our priorities are.  - How would we approach storing that information    # Problem:  How to store context    - Adding an `origin` field, with the values `""github""` or `""codecorps""` would be simplest, but would not provide us with all the possibilities listed above  - Adding fields  to the task/comment would be most straightforward, but would grow the models in complexity  - Adding a relationship to a `GithubIssue`/`GithubComment` would probably be an improvement over that  - It may be enough to just have the view fetch the information from the API at render time, in some cases, but I don't really like that, just listing it as an option.  - It may be something that the client would be able to do in an asynchronous manner. We would just provide the basic information the client needs, in order to fetch more. Presumably,  not all of our potential future clients would need this info.    "

__label__question "git vcs a dependency? ## Issue Type  ""Question""    Yesterday i've tried to enable atom eslint in a project. It wasn't a real project, but more some testing/fun stuff, so i wasn't using git yet. It was a little weird, only after removing the project folder, an open file would be checked with eslint, otherwise eslint didn't seem to be run at all.  But once i ran `git init .` in the project folder (and maybe a restart of atom) it started working and showing all the errors and warnings in my code.  Now i wonder if git is really a dependency for atom eslint, since it isn't communicated in the readme or anywhere else, or is this probably due to side effects from some other plugin?"

__label__question "standard extension API inconsistency? The standard extensions provides API for creating `u1`, `u2`, `u3`, and `U` gates.  ```  q = QuantumRegister(""q"", 3)  c = ClassicalRegister(""c"", 3)  qc = QuantumCircuit(q, c)  qc.u2(pi/2, 0.3*pi, q[1]) # <- two real parameters, one qubit.  ```  Similarly with `u3`:  ```  qc.u3(pi,pi/2, 0.3*pi, q[1]) # <- three real parameters, one qubit.  ```    But the way to interact with `U` is different:  ```  qc.u_base([pi, pi/2, 0.3*pi], q[1]) # <- one array, one qubit.  ```  Is this intended?    ## Expected Behavior  I would expect to create a`U` gate the same way that a `u3` gate is created:  ```  qc.u_base(pi,pi/2, 0.3*pi, q[1]) # <- three real parameters, one qubit.  ```    ## Possible Solution  Changing an API is something to avoid when possible.

__label__question "Question: Does the name used with azurerm_network_security_rule need to be unique? Hi there,    Thank you for opening an issue. Please note that we try to keep the Terraform issue tracker reserved for bug reports and feature requests. For general usage questions, please see: https://www.terraform.io/community.html.    ### Terraform Version  Run `terraform -v` to show the version. If you are not running the latest version of Terraform, please upgrade because your issue may have already been fixed.    ### Affected Resource(s)  - azurerm_network_security_rule    ### Terraform Configuration Files    I was expecting that as long as I use unique resource names, that I could use generic (thus the same) NSG rule names, as the portal allows this... However this doesn't seem to be the case.   When I have NSG rules like so...    ```hcl  resource ""azurerm_network_security_rule"" ""snCmpUatApp_O_116"" {    name                        = ""snCmpDataCus_Datastax_JMX_9042""    description                 = ""snCmpDataCus_Datastax_JMX_9042""    priority                    = 116    direction                   = ""Outbound""    access                      = ""Allow""    protocol                    = ""tcp""    source_port_range           = ""*""    destination_port_range      = ""9042""    source_address_prefix       = ""172.30.21.32/28""    destination_address_prefix  = ""172.30.7.150/32""    resource_group_name         = ""${var.vnet_rg_name}""    network_security_group_name = ""${azurerm_network_security_group.snCmpUatApp.name}""  }    resource ""azurerm_network_security_rule"" ""snCmpUatApp_O_117"" {    name                        = ""snCmpDataCus_Datastax_JMX_9042""    description                 = ""snCmpDataCus_Datastax_JMX_9042""    priority                    = 117    direction                   = ""Outbound""    access                      = ""Allow""    protocol                    = ""tcp""    source_port_range           = ""*""    destination_port_range      = ""9042""    source_address_prefix       = ""172.30.21.32/28""    destination_address_prefix  = ""172.30.7.151/32""    resource_group_name         = ""${var.vnet_rg_name}""    network_security_group_name = ""${azurerm_network_security_group.snCmpUatApp.name}""  }  ```    and after you build it, you would see stuff like this in a terraform plan..  ```    ~ azurerm_network_security_rule.snCmpUatApp_O_120        priority:                    ""122"" => ""120""  ```    etc. Basically it will switch the priority between the two ""same"" nsg rules, but not switch the destination_address_prefix.      ### Expected Behavior  What should have happened?    terraform would create two rules, priority 116 and priority 117.      ### Actual Behavior  What actually happened?    Terraform will create one rule (usually the first one, so snCmpUatApp_O_116 in this example), but not the second one (snCmpUatApp_O_117). Subsequent plan/applies will see terraform ""flip"" the priority values between the two rules, but not the difference destination_address_prefix. Every time you run plan/apply.    Changing the name to something else (so it's not identical) will correct this issue. Is this a bug or by design? (aka because of how the API is, using identical named nsg rules don't really work despite what you can do in the portal)    ### Steps to Reproduce  Please list the steps required to reproduce the issue, for example:  1. `terraform apply`  "
__label__question "New user requires review Hi,    I'm trying to implement ngrx-forms into an application I'm working on and so far everything is working and  a whole bunch of code has been removed or moved from components to reducers, which is great. Before I continue the implementation I'd like a quick review of the way I'm working since I'm not 100% sure it's done the way it should be done, especially the validation and adding/updating addresses. The reason for the unusual approach with address is because there is only 1 form for adding/editing them and not a form per address.    ```typescript  export const FORM_ID = 'asset';  export const SUBADDRESSFORM_ID = 'asset_address';    export interface State {      currentSubaddress: FormGroupState<AssetAddress>;      formState: FormGroupState<Asset>;  }    const initialState: State = {      currentSubaddress: undefined,      formState: createFormGroupState<Asset>(FORM_ID, new Asset())  };    const validationFormGroup = updateGroup<Asset>({      location: updateGroup<AssetLocation>({           address: updateGroup<AssetAddress>({               countryCode: validate(required)           })      })  });    const assetFormReducer = createFormGroupReducerWithUpdate<Asset>({      location: updateGroup<AssetLocation>({           address: updateGroup<AssetAddress>({               countryCode: validate(required)           })      })    });    export const addOrReplaceAddressInAssetIdentification = (asset: Asset, address: AssetAddress): Asset => {      const addressIndex = asset.identification.addresses.findIndex(c => c.id == address.id);      let newAddresses: AssetAddress[];      if(addressIndex != -1) {          newAddresses = [              ...asset.identification.addresses.slice(0, addressIndex),              address,              ...asset.identification.addresses.slice(addressIndex + 1)          ];      }      else {          newAddresses = [              ...asset.identification.addresses,              address          ];      }        return new Asset({          ...asset,          identification: new AssetIdentification({              ...asset.identification,              addresses: newAddresses          })      });  }    export function reducer(state = initialState, action: assetDetail.All): State {      state = {          ...state,          formState: assetFormReducer(state.formState, action),          currentSubaddress: state.currentSubaddress != undefined ? formGroupReducer(state.currentSubaddress, action) : undefined      };        switch (action.type) {          case assetDetail.SAVE_SUBADDRESS:              const addressToSave = state.currentSubaddress.value;              const currentAsset = state.formState.value;                return {                  ...state,                  currentSubaddress: undefined,                  formState: validationFormGroup(createFormGroupState<Asset>(FORM_ID, addOrReplaceAddressInAssetIdentification(currentAsset, addressToSave)))              }          case assetDetail.DONE_WITH_SUBADDRESS:              return {                  ...state,                  currentSubaddress: undefined              }          case assetDetail.EDIT_SUBADDRESS:              return {                  ...state,                  currentSubaddress: createFormGroupState<AssetAddress>(SUBADDRESSFORM_ID, action.payload.value)              }          case assetDetail.ADD_SUBADDRESS:              return {                  ...state,                  currentSubaddress: createFormGroupState<AssetAddress>(SUBADDRESSFORM_ID, new AssetAddress())              }          case assetDetail.LOAD_COMPLETE:              return {                  ...state,                  progress: new Set<string>(),                  formState: validationFormGroup(createFormGroupState<Asset>(FORM_ID, action.payload))              };          default:              return state;      }  }  ```    Thanks in advace for your time!"

I have a clean centos 7.4 VM located in the same azure region (UK South) as my blob storage account. I've installed the `blobfuse` tool using `yum` with the package source listed on the wiki. I'm currently using root for everything.    I've created a temp directory in /mnt/resources and a config file in /root/conf/betaep1.cfg -- which it is able to read because if it can't it fails differently.    The content of my cfg file is (removing the key):    ```  accountName onefilearc  accountKey [redacted]  containerName testfuse  ```    The storage account is a blob-storage account, the container exists and contains files and can be accessed with the key via e.g. powershell, .net libraries. I thought perhaps the ""account"" name needed to be different and so tried the blob storage endpoint url and tried that.

At the moment if someone leaves a game half way through you have no option but to remake the game. You also can't remove people who you don't wish to play with but haven't necessary broken any rules.     Currently, this makes it very difficult to set up a mic only game. If I start a lobby and advertise it as mic only, if someone joins without a mic then I cannot remove them. The only way around this is to start a private game and spam discord links in chat and hope that enough people join the discord to get the password.     It would be so much better if the lobby creator could remove people from seats and could control when the game starts. This would allow them to kick AFKers and just restart the game and wait for 1 extra player to join and fill in, rather than remaking the entire game (this feature would also allow you to play a rematch with the same players without having to leave the lobby and create a new one).  Additionally this would help to combat trolls as the lobby creator could easily remove people without the need for site wide mods to always be there.     As well as this it would make it easier to set up a mic only game since you could wait for people to join discord and if they didn't you could remove them from the seats and only start the game when everyone has confirmed they have a mic.

For example request sent to `/order/123/status` will match the action and value `123` shall be set into path variable `id`.    Note the current implementation is using named group regex mapping, for the above case, the pattern is `(?<id>.*?)`, obviously this is an inefficient solution for this case.      "

This will also allow us to support more features like     - PDF export   - Multiple sizes   - Include module table in the export     The only difference I can foresee is that font may be different because currently we use the OS default font, which obviously the server cannot support, but this is a small issue.

__label__enhancement "ChannelAbilityPreset uses some questionable order strings Since it uses OrderStringFactory without any specific requirements, it ends up with harmful orders. You should NEVER give ""AIMove"" to a channel ability, because it will trigger if AI is ordered to move. I just had a situation in my map where my worker was attacked and he immediately started casting the channel-based ability with the order string ""AIMove"" because he's forced to flee.    I think ChannelAbilityPreset should give order ids that you can actually give to the unit at least somewhat safely, the AIMove order is always going to be used because it's close to the start of the order list. So my suggestion is to hand pick the order strings to reduce the chance of this happening, as well as giving an optional argument to ChannelAbilityPreset's constructor (well, giving the user a new constructor) where they can input their own order string. I know  you can still do it by setting it otherwise, this would just be a handier way to do it.    OrderStringFactory should probably be reworked to at least push harmful orders to the bottom, and I think it should also have a blacklist that you can set if you know you're using specific orders. Like, I would blacklist the orders of abilities I know I am using alongside channel based abilities.    EDIT: I just figured out AIMove was getting triggered by something else. However it's still true that there should be a filter for what values the factory can generate."

__label__enhancement "Known ordering for RollupCalculateJob records Hey there, I'm a huge fan of the tool and recommend it to anyone that needs rollups (virtually everyone).    I think there might be a feature missing to ensure there is a known order of records when using the ""Calculate"" or ""Schedule Calculate"" feature. It appears that `RollupCalculateJob` is getting the query locator from `RollupService.masterRecordsAsQueryLocator`, though I do not see where this is implementing an `ORDER BY` clause.    If the user were to start a calculation for a rollup, it does not seem that the user should need to wait until that calculation finishes to begin the next rollup (provided the same parent object exists).    If the query returned from `RollupService.masterRecordsAsQueryLocator` were to use an `ORDER BY` clause as part of the query string, the order would be predictable, and thus the rollups could be staggered to start by a few minutes.    1. Is the statement above correct (re: predictable order)?  1. If so, would you like me to submit a PR with the proposed changes?

This feature will helps user create simple resolver without having to leave config file, this will also improve performance by removing an external resolver call.    **edit:** treating json string directy in your resolver  - before:  ```yaml  Object:    type: object    config:      fields:        name:          type: String!          resolve: ""@=resolver('json_decode', [value.json_data, true])['name']""   ```  ```php  namespace App\GraphQL\Resolver;    use Overblog\GraphQLBundle\Definition\Resolver\AliasedInterface;  use Overblog\GraphQLBundle\Definition\Resolver\ResolverInterface;    class JsonResolver  implements ResolverInterface, AliasedInterface  {      public function jsonDecode($json, $assoc)      {          return json_decode($json, $assoc);      }        public static function getAliases()      {          return [              'jsonDecode' => 'json_decode',          ];      }  }  ```    - after:  ```yaml  Object:    type: object    config:      fields:        name:          type: String!          resolve: ""@=json_decode(value.json_data, true)['name']""   ```    ```php  namespace App\ExpressionLanguage;    use Overblog\GraphQLBundle\ExpressionLanguage\ExpressionFunction;    class JsonDecode extends ExpressionFunction  {      public function __construct()      {          parent::__construct(              'json_encode',              function ($json, $assoc) {                  return sprintf('json_decode(%s, %s)', $value, $assoc);              }          );      }  }  ```    ```yaml  App\ExpressionLanguage\JsonDecode:    tags: ['overblog_graphql.expression_function']  ```          "

But it seems that it's done in two steps:    - first: copy all sources to TMPDIR (/tmp by default)  - second: make them available inside the VM (sometimes it's a copy but it can be just mounting the temp dir with data inside the VM)    In our case, we use kitchen to test a full repository of salt states/pillars and files, which is several hundreds of MB.

For instance, if all the vendor dependencies are extracted to its own bundle, then the common chunk should decrease in size and you will hopefully also be able to load your application faster since the files will be downloaded in parallel.    So, one option is to add support for creating any chunk you would like, and another option is to add support for specifying what vendors you have and having Sagui create a vendor chunk for you and include it in the entries alongside the common chunk.

A drop-in extension would read as follows:    ```js  const O = (x, ...more) =>    x    ? more.length      ? P(x, ...more)      : typeof x === 'function'        ? new S(x)        : PS(x)    : D  ```    …such that, testing sequentially:    | Overload invocation…  | …forks to |  | ------------- | ------------- |  | `O()` | `D` |  | `O(...severalArguments)` | `P(...severalArguments)` |  | `O(function)` | `S(function)` |  | `O(oneNonFunctionArgument)` | `PS(oneNonFunctionArgument)` |    This comes at the cost of disabling immutable `PS(replacement, patch)` since multiple arguments are necessarily forwarded to `P`.

Then just a black screen. Had to force shut down. Happened on windows 8.1. I know this information isn't particularly helpful, but try to decompile a fairly large 32-bit executable and watch the ram usage. I may be the only one who got a black screen, but can't be the only one with RAM usage sky rocketing to unreasonable levels.    As a side note, congratulations on the project. Even though I couldn't use this yet, I read https://retdec.com/web/files/publications/retdec-slides-botconf-2017.pdf and thought it's awesome. This program seems to decompile with the same quality or even better than hex-rays, and that's really something considering that all other decompilers I've tested so far besides hex-rays sucked. This decompiler seems very powerful. I guess I was just unlucky, but hopefully I'll be able to use it soon. Congratulations."
__label__enhancement "Expose error metric function in the compression settings It is imperative that the error metric function be as close as what the host game engine will use internally to compute and blend poses.

This would also allow support for VQM transforms."

__label__enhancement "Validation ## Goal  Make it easier to extend the syntax and make compiler easier to work with.    ## Overview  This should unblock #28     Currently, the individual node parsing methods perform in-place validation on the syntax. For example, the identifier parser may throw an undefined variable syntax error if it cannot identify the variable.    https://github.com/ballercat/walt/blob/296f1cb1d19188c29e63ea96b6873df94781ba20/src/parser/maybe-identifier.js#L48    This is OK, but the more syntax is extended the harder it is to extend the behavior. In the above code, the undefined variable handler is overwritten to silence the error while parsing function arguments(while parsing the parent node). Instead of doing the above, let's have another step before the generator, a static type/validator checker.    The final pipeline will look like this:    `Tokenizer -> tokens -> Parser -> ast -> Static Checker -> ast/dag -> Generator -> ir -> Emitter -> bytecode`    Initial implementation would only handle `Identifier` nodes. This means the static checker would do the following:    - [ ] Ensure the identifier is valid/in-scope  - [x] Patch nodes to attach correct metadata, like global/local indexes, type definitions, function indexes and table pointers  - [ ] throw syntax errors if the identifier is undefined and only do so in correct context. For example, it should be fine for an identifier to be undefined in a function definition because that is the first node it's defined in.  - [x] Code generation needs to be moved entirely to its own step. Currently, functions generate IR in-place but this will need to change.    <!-- REMOVE THE COMMENTED OUT SECTION WHICH APPLIES TO YOUR ISSUE -->  <!-- Bug Reports  # Bug Report  ## Overview  One two sentence of the problem, if possible.    ## Expected  What _should_ happen    ## Actual  What _did_ happen    ## Example  For best results the shortest possible code snippet or spec.    -->    <!-- Feature Request  # Feature Request  ## Overview  Elevator pitch.  # Impact  Small, Medium, Large, Extra-Large.

__label__enhancement "swarm needs a gateway mode (transparent proxy that rewrites bzz:// URLs) Context:   You can run swarm on a local node and see swarm content on http://localhost:8500 or you could access swarm via a gateway. These require different HTML content than if you have a bzz:// URL handler installed in your browser.    Problem:  Swarm is meant to serve HTTP content for web3 dapps and serverless websites such as our swarm homepage `theswarm.eth`. In the HTML of that website we want to have URLs of the form  ```  bzz://theswarm.eth/images/some-image.png  ```  but at the moment we are using the *relative URL*  ```  bzz:/theswarm.eth/some-image.png  ```  which loads  ```  http://localhost:8500/bzz:/theswarm.eth/images/some-image.png  or  http://swarm-gateways.net/bzz:/theswarm.eth/images/some-image.png  ```    This is not good. We cannot have the _content_ of swarm hosted websites to have to be adapted in this way. We need the following:      1. Default behaviour of all swarm hosted websites should be to use `bzz://` URLs.    2a. It should be possibly to run swarm with a `--gateway` flag which adds a transparent proxy to all swarm content, replacing `bzz://` with `http://localhost:8500/bzz:/` or with `http://gateway-url/bzz:/`.    2b. Swarm should not come with a gateway mode itself, but come bundled with an nginx config file that achieves the same as 2a. We should then describe this method in documentation and here: https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/8187/how-to-run-a-swarm-gateway      ----  Some notes:  An alternative is to do the re-writing client side, but then you cannot surf swarm content without a browser plugin / bzz:// handler     "

I should be able to specify a specific service account and not include any scopes.    ### Actual Behavior  ""scopes"" is a _required_ param- this is wrong. Using scopes like this is deprecated as well. If you specify a service account access is granted based on roles associated with that specific account. If you _don't_ specify a service account your using the default GCE account and then can grant specific access via scopes. Because scopes is required it means if I specify a service account I still have to specify specific scopes which defeats the purpose of a service account! In fact the GCP console doesn't even let you specify scopes if you specify a service account when creating a new instance.    ### Suggestion  Perhaps you should have an option to just allow ALL scopes. This seems to be what happens when you create an instance through the console with a specific account. ""Cloud API access scopes"" is set to ""Allow full access to all Cloud APIs"".

__label__enhancement "Sanity Checks of the Database All data in CWS is stored encrypted, and to verify that the data is still valid, a checksum is generated on the encrypted data and stored in the database. Upon reading out the encrypted data, the checksum is verified and if it fails, an error is returned.    Since the check is only made upon reading it, it can be that over time an Object has become corrupted and is no longer valid. For that reason, it will be helpful to add a Sanity check of the data, which can be either run at startup and/or at regular intervals. The check is running as a background job, and cannot be invoked via the API (it is controlled via the settings).    Two new setting keys will be added:    `# If the Sanity check should be performed at startup or not, default is true.`  `cws.sanity.check.startup = true`    `# The interval between sanity checks, meassured in days.`  `cws.sanity.check.interval = 180`    The result will be stored in a field next to the encrypted data, which will contain the the check result and timestamp of the last check. If it fails, then no more checks will be made, if it is successful, then it will be check at next startup    To also get a report, a new request will be added to the system interface, which can only be invoked by the System Administrator. The result of the request will be report of failed Objects and when they failed.    Note, the initial version of the sanity check is for standalone installations, i.e. systems where only a single instance of CWS is running. it is planned to extend this feature with domain support, to avoid that each CWS instance is performing sanity checks, when running multiple instances.

Should the chapter list be processed before downloading to remove duplicates, keeping the last one uploaded by date? If version identification can reliably identify the latest version, should that be used instead? Should an option be added to add the chapter title to the filename, so that both files can be downloaded and the user then choose which one to use? The last is very simple to implement, and the only one that will behave exactly the same regardless of when and how many times mangarack is run.

And then does its magic calculation (not important here).  If i am looking at the following code              s.lookback.slice(0, length).forEach(function (period) {            if (last_close) {              if (period.close > last_close) {                gain_sum += period.close - last_close              }              else {                loss_sum += last_close - period.close              }            }            last_close = period.close          })      Lets assume that we have RSI_Length of 3 and 4 Lookback data of [6 (youngest) , 7 , 5, 4 (oldest, but not in RSI_Length)]  It will start with the youngest lookback and will use the following numbers (6 -> 7 -> 5) for calculation.  So the calculation will be the following, if i am understanding it right:  1. iteration last_close = NULL --> use 6  2. iteration 7 > 6 so gain_sum = 1  3. iteration 5 < 7 so loss_sum = 2    On my option the calculation has to be reversed, because actually moving from  lookback[2] to lookback[1] is a gain and not a loss!  Right values should be:  gain_sum =  2  (candle 5 --> 7)   loss_sum = 1 (candle 7 --> 6)    So i think there is an reverse() missing before iteration?     Can some one with more experience please re-check this?    "

__label__enhancement "IsItemHovered(), IsWindowHovered() improvements (This is a news/info post. Will close in a few days)    I have pushed a bunch of changes related to the IsItemHovered() and IsWindowHovered() functions, in the form of new flags.     This is interesting to know:  - If you are using mouse-triggered popups (~context menus) this is also interesting.  - If you are using Drag'n Drop related idioms (#143) in your code this will likely interest you, and might affect you.  - If you are using any other idioms related to hovering, most commonly when creating tooltip or displaying status based on hovered items.    Previously it was frequent to use `IsItemRectHovered`/`IsItemHoveredRect` (same function, was renamed on August 22) to do a basic rectangle-only test.    The existing normal functions now have flags to allow this and more, with better defined options:  ```  bool IsItemHovered(ImGuiHoveredFlags flags = 0);  bool IsWindowHovered(ImGuiHoveredFlags flags = 0);  ```    The flags are:  ```  enum ImGuiHoveredFlags_  {      ImGuiHoveredFlags_Default                       = 0,        // Return true if directly over the item/window, not obstructed by another window, not obstructed by an active popup or modal blocking inputs under them.      ImGuiHoveredFlags_AllowWhenBlockedByPopup       = 1 << 0,   // Return true even if a popup window is normally blocking access to this item/window      //ImGuiHoveredFlags_AllowWhenBlockedByModal     = 1 << 1,   // Return true even if a modal popup window is normally blocking access to this item/window. FIXME-TODO: Unavailable yet.      ImGuiHoveredFlags_AllowWhenBlockedByActiveItem  = 1 << 2,   // Return true even if an active item is blocking access to this item/window      ImGuiHoveredFlags_AllowWhenOverlapped           = 1 << 3,   // Return true even if the position is overlapped by another window      ImGuiHoveredFlags_RectOnly                      = ImGuiHoveredFlags_AllowWhenBlockedByPopup | ImGuiHoveredFlags_AllowWhenBlockedByActiveItem | ImGuiHoveredFlags_AllowWhenOverlapped  };  ```    - This is particularly useful for contextual menu triggered from an item. The high-level `BeginPopupContextItem()` helper now uses the `ImGuiHoveredFlags_AllowWhenBlockedByPopup` flag meaning that you can right-click again on a different spot to reopen a context menu. (#439). Note that I also have committed another change that allows closing popups by right-clicking anywhere, making popups generally more usable.    - Those new options will make it easier/clearer to have finer controls on drag and drop related behaviour.  - If you use e.g. tooltip you can also have finer controls as to how when they should appear.    In the demo window you can visualize the output of those functions will different flags:    ![hovered](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8225057/31837945-ff7f9800-b5da-11e7-9ea7-e023aebb0d25.png)  Above: normal hovering.    ![hovered_allow_when_overlapped](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8225057/31837968-1570c40e-b5db-11e7-9366-bea5b7faeec5.png)  Above: Here the button is hidden by another window, but `IsItemHovered(ImGuiHoveredFlags_AllowWhenOverlapped)`/`RectOnly` call returns true as expected:    ![hovered_allow_when_blocked_by_popup](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8225057/31838003-36b2b65e-b5db-11e7-826b-01897f633d63.png)  Above: Here there is an open popup (the color picker) which prevents from clicking the button ""ITEM"" (so it doesn't appear as hovered). The `IsItemHovered(ImGuiHoveredFlags_AllowWhenBlockedByPopup)` and `IsWindowHovered(ImGuiHoveredFlags_AllowWhenBlockedByPopup)` calls both returns true.    ![hovered_allow_when_blocked_by_active](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8225057/31838060-71bf036a-b5db-11e7-8be0-bacfd43848a9.png)  Above: Here I have clicked on the DRAG ME button and click-dragged the mouse over the ITEM button. The `IsItemHovered(ImGuiHoveredFlags_AllowWhenBlockedByActiveItem)` returns true.    Hope it is clear, and useful!  I haven't worked out in details how those features may relate to parent-child window relationship, and I imagine we could introduce new flags there.    BREAKING CHANGES  - `IsItemHoveredRect/IsItemRectHovered` has been obsoleted, it is equivalent to calling: `IsItemHovered(ImGuiHoveredFlags_RectOnly)` aka all the flags enabled. I have kept an inline function doing that.  - On August 22 I renamed `IsItemHoveredRect` to `IsItemRectHovered` for consistency with other functions. Instead of keeping 2 legacy names, I have now completely removed the name introduced on August 22, since few people will have renamed it their code, and if they did they are likely to find their way through the new changes. So only the oldest legacy name persist and it will be obsoleted in a few months/years.    - Similarly, `IsWindowRectHovered()` has been obsoleted, the exact behavior that it had is equivalent to calling `IsWindowHovered(ImGuiHoveredFlags_AllowWhenBlockedByPopup | ImGuiHoveredFlags_AllowWhenBlockedByActiveItem)`.  - Similarly, on August 22 I renamed `IsMouseHoveringWindow` to `IsWindowRectHovered` and I have removed the most recently introduced name. So the oldest legacy name `IsMouseHoveringWindow` will persist for a few more months/years.    - `IsWindowHovered()` default behavior has been changed to return false if an item of another window is active. It makes the function more consistent and symmetrical with `IsItemHovered()` and I believe it is a better default and won't affect many people. You can call `IsWindowHovered(ImGuiHoveredFlags_AllowWhenBlockedByActiveItem)` to get the old behavior.  This will probably affect you if you were doing drag and drop across windows and using `IsWindowHovered`.    "

Per closed issue #1034, Used is calculated as:    unsigned long long Used = MemTotal - MemFree - Cached - Buffers;    I have been using this ""Used"" metric as a percentage of MemTotal (calc'd through Netdata provided metrics as the sum of free, used, cached and buffers) to track how close the system is to being out of memory (OOM) when it approaches and hits 100% Used.    However, while (MemTotal - Used) does seem to be close to the OS provided metric of MemAvailable most of the time based on observation, they do report different results.    From the kernel commit comment at [https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=34e431b0ae398fc54ea69ff85ec700722c9da773](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=34e431b0ae398fc54ea69ff85ec700722c9da773), MemAvailable does a calculation that's a little more involved that what (MemTotal - Used) amounts to, and that calculation may change in the future.    For those of us who would like to track available system memory closely and accurately, wouldn't it be good to provide the OS calculated MemAvailable metric as well since that seems to differ by a least a small extent to the estimate of (MemTotal - Used)?    Or is there a better way to look at this than I am doing?  Or maybe I'm missing something?    Thanks!    John          "

__label__enhancement "Views for all typed arrays with alignment, member offset decorators. If I allocate an array like float32[1024] I should be able to map it to float32x4 and perform SIMD operations on it with no overhead.    I'm unsure of the syntax at the moment. Typed arrays already have view syntax with buffer.  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Typed_arrays    ```js  TODO  ```    Someone I was talking to asked that I include a stride. So basically:    ```js  new uint32[](buffer [, byteOffset [, length [, stride]]]);  ```    The idea that you could create an array of the data types or an array of typed objects and map them to a binary store. So if you load some byte data from a memory mapped file you can immediately put a class mapping over it without doing any allocations. Another example would be creating a pool allocator and using stride to ensure alignment is preserved.        SIMD can benefit from alignment so a reserved decorator @align(n), @offset(n), @size(n) would be nice on a per member instance. align would ensure that allocations of a class are aligned to an address that's a multiple of the specific align amount. offset would offset a specific member by a number of bytes. size would set the size of a class. Not sure if decorators are ideal for this or if the language needs keywords.    ```js  @align(16)  @size(32) // Says the the class is 32 bytes. Pads with zeros when allocating  class Test  {      @offset(2)      x:float32; // aligned to 16 because of the class alignment and offset by 2 bytes      @align(4)      y:float32x4; // 2 (from the offset above) + 4 (for x) is 6 bytes and we said it has to be aligned to 4 bytes so 8 bytes offset from the front. Instead of @align(4) we could have put @offset(8)  }  ```    The align, offset, and size can be evaluated at evaluation. Might be nice to seal or freeze the class with special syntax. Ideally these are POD structs essentially.    Might edit this later. Needed to jot this down since it keeps coming up in discussions."

Since Ansible checks the environment first (see [2] after the list of links), we could set a log file in the wrapper `/opt/vm/logs/$TAG/$(date '+%Y%m%d-%H%M%S').log`.

There is also a 3-Minute read, on how to format your issue:      https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/      This template is optional, but it may help us fix your issue faster. --> ### Issue  Replication progress feedback is required for users of large dbs. The best way I have found so far is to use `last_seq / update_seq`, as described [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29138091/pouchdb-couchdb-sequence-counter-on-replicate/29143448#29143448) by @nolanlawson .  However, recently I was bitten by this technique as `update_seq` is unique to each db and replicating to an empty db does not guarantee `update_seq` will match after replication has completed. This results in a progress value that never reaches 100%, and can break other logic that is waiting for that condition.  Try as I might, I cannot get an **ACCURATE** _Progress Value_ based on the data given by the  `.on('change', ...)` event.  The values don't seem to add up. I've tried countless combinations of these stats `docs_read, docs_written, last_seq, docs.length, remote.info(), update_seq`, but I can never arrive at a 100% complete value (with certainty for all cases).  Is there a better algorithm for calculating replication progress other than `last_seq / update_seq` ?   I'd prefer not to have to poll the /_active_tasks endpoint etc for progress too.  If a more robust algorithm is found, I would be happy to write a plugin. ### Info - Server: CouchDB 2.0   (with `pending` docs avail in _changes feed) "

Suggestion for the repo name appreciated. Here I temporarily use *`openni_meta`*.    New repo and the contents (being updated over time taking suggestions in):    ```  ros-drivers/openni_meta  |- freenect_camera  |- freenect_launch  |- openni_camera  |- openni_launch  |- openni_meta  |- rgbd_launch  ```    `openni_meta` is a meta package that run_depends on these 3 packages.

We have a few workarounds in prototype that need to be enhanced. - [ ] `PerformanceCounter` - not supported in .NET Core. - [ ] `Environment.UserName` - [ ] `CallContext.LogicalSetData` - potentially replace with `AsyncLocal<T>` - [ ] Update codegen to be more aggressive and generate serializers for Exception types - [ ] `SerializationInfo` - not supported in .NET Core.  2nd priority - [ ] Compile time codegen working with new dotnet cli tooling (although be aware that the tooling will drop support for `project.json` once it RTMs, and we are not sure if the build tools will work once they start using csproj once again)   - [ ] Avoid having OrleansCodeGenerator depend on Orleans project, since that creates a circular dependency to getting codegen to work easily (especially since Orleans.dll requires build time codegen). This is a nice to have, but not required if we solve the previous item in some other way. - [ ] Allow `TestCluster` to work without creating new AppDomains for each silo (for example, by leveraging containers, or spawning and managing new processes)  3rd priority - [ ] Separate test projects for each provider that brings in a new dependency (ideally even if that dependency is also supported in .NET Core, otherwise we would need to port the entire codebase before we can start testing each individual component we port) - [ ] CI servers run tests in many platforms - [x] `System.Runtime.Serialization.FormatterServices.GetUninitializedObject` - [x] `System.Diagnostics.Process.Handle` -> `System.Diagnostics.Process.SafeHandle`  ---  **Already done issues (for progress tracking):** - [x] `Type.IsInterface`-> `Type.GetTypeInfo.IsInterface` (`IsClass`, `IsGenericType` , `IsAbstract`, `IsPrimitive`, `IsEnum`). - [x] `Type` -> `TypeInfo` for most members (in Orleans code, and code generated by OrleansCodeGenerator) #1783 #1894 #1997  - [x] `TextReader.Close` -> `TextReader.Dispose` #609 #2034 - [x] `Socket.Close` -> `Socket.Dispose` - [x] `Delegate.CreateDelegate` -> `MethodInfo.CreateDelegate` - [x] `ApplicationException(string)` - [x] `System.Data` and `System.Transactions` - used in SQL utils. Create a separate OrleansSQLUtils project and move all [Relational Storage](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/tree/master/src/Orleans/RelationalStorage) code there. - [x] `XmlTextWriter` and `XMLNode.SelectNodes`. - [x] `Dns.GetHostAddresses`. - [x] `System.String.ToLower(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture)` -> Use `CultureInfo.TextInfo.ToLower(String)` instead - [x] `System.UriTypeConverter`. - [x] `System.CodeDom.CodeTypeParameter`. - [x] `BinaryFormatter.Serialize` - solved via #1047. - [x] `System.Management.ManagementObjectCollection` -  not supported in .NET Core. Investigate and propose alternative options (if `ManagementObject` itself is supported). We use it now in one place, to find TotalPhysicalMemory. Solved via #1048 "

The person assumes all people will get the same result in the table, as all the filters are in the link.    Example config:  ```              state: {                  types: ['hash', 'local_storage'],                  filters: true,                  page_number: true,                  page_length: true,                  sort: true,                  columns_visibility: true,                  filters_visibility: true              },  ```    **Reproduction steps:**    I'll describe here how to reproduce the situation on one PC using two different browsers.

__label__enhancement "[Suggestion] Compactor + Blaze/Blitz/Basalz/Blizz Pretty self explanatory, I was compacting 5 Blaze powder into a rod via IC2 today and thought to myself that it would be really cool if I could use TE to do that, as I've never really gotten into IC2 at all (no where near as pretty, fun or well engineered ;) ).    IMO 4 powder into a rod might be too powerful with the secondary outputs from pulverizing, meaning 5 could also be well balanced for TE. If you've ever thought about using the other rods for any recipes, I think it would be super handy to be able to make them this way.    ---    Completely separate suggestion, but following on from that idea, I'd also LOVE it if there could be blocks of the rods, so 9 rods into a block like a Blaze lantern. I think it would be great for decoration, maybe even have them emit light. Alternatively, I'd also suggest that you could even bring back the Glowstone Illuminator, with various TE fluids enabling different colours and the rods enabling different coloured frames! If you wanted to add some steps for balance or to increase the cost of entry, I'd suggest transposing Energised Glowstone into various solids (Enderium blend, Redstone, Blizz powder etc.) to generate glowing variants of items, to then put into rod frames to create the lantern. That's a whole completely different suggestion in-of-itself though, lmk if I should put it through as a separate thread if that's easier.    ---    Thanks for reading, and for all of your hard work, I couldn't bring myself to get into 1.12 until TE was all updated!"

However, when you are starting out, you haven't even entered that initial state.  There should be a way to get to that initial state, and any side effects.

What's even worse, `Function startDragging()` will be fired twice.  Currently, I manually unbind the events with the following code before re-initialization, `$('#content-view .resize-grip').off('mousedown.rsz touchstart.rsz');` I think that would be great if the plugin can provide a destroy or a update methods for users.

It's also however a rather tricky subject to deal with, but I believe I have a solution that should work, and be fairly idiomatic using F# attributes.    If we introduce the following interface/abstract base attribute class:    ```fsharp  type IDecoratorAttribute =    abstract Target: obj    abstract Args: obj list  ```    Which can be used like this:    ```fsharp  module AngularBindings    // I don't know these functions, but you should get   let compDec = import ""Component"" ""angular""the point    [<AttributeUsage(AttributeTarget.Class)>]  type ComponentAttribute () =    let mutable selector: String option    // Don't know if this works, haven't used attributes in F# in forever    member x.Selector with set v = selector <- Some v      interface IDecoratorAttribute with      member x.Target = compDec      member x.Args =        [ ""selector"", selector ]        |> List.map (fun (k, v) -> Option.map (fun v -> k, v) v)        |> List.choose id        |> createObj    // later  [<Component(Selector = ""my-app"")>]  type Foo =    ...  ```    This could compile into something like this:    ```js  import toDecorator from 'fable-core/decorator';    @toDecorator(() => {    const attr = new ComponentAttribute();    attr.Selector = 'my-app';    return attr;  }())  class Foo {}  ```    It's not exactly pretty, but it would work, and enable support for a bunch of angular stuff, and some react stuff (like mobx) etc."
__label__enhancement "Enable DocumentDB server-side programming ## Enable DocumentDB server-side programming    This issue suggests adding Azure DocumentDB server side scripts as a Fable execution target. Since Azure functions support F# and there is good Functions-DocumentDB integration this will enable a ""full-stack"" F# programming experiance Fable SPA->Functions->DocumentDB hopefully passing F# records all the way.     Document DB is Azure's No-SQL database offering. It's native storage format is JSON and it's language for serverside scripting (stored procedures, triggers, post save actions userdefined functions) is JavaScript, specifically ECMA-262. See https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/documentdb/documentdb-programming.       ## Creating Stored Procedures in JavaScrip  Using a DocumentDB server-side script involves the following steps:  1. Writing a JavaScript function. The function must include in its body all code needed for the script, there is no way to reference external libraries or files.  2. Registering the function with a DocumentDB. One way of doing this is POSTing the JavaScript source to the Database.   3. Calling the function. For exmaple a stored procedure may be called by exeuting a POST request against its URI passing any parameters as a JSON Array of JSON object.    JavaScript scripts can be created, registred and called using a number of DocumentDB SDKs:  * [Node.js client with Q Promises](http://azure.github.io/azure-documentdb-node-q/)  * .Net SDKs  * Straight JavaScript  * REST API    The following is an example of how to register and execute a stored procedure using the REST API:    ```  POST https://dbs/testdb/colls/testColl/sprocs/sprocs/ HTTP/1.1  authorization: <<auth>>  x-ms-date: Thu, 07 Aug 2014 03:43:10 GMT      var x = {  ""name"": ""createAndAddProperty"",  ""body"": function (docToCreate, addedPropertyName, addedPropertyValue) {              var collectionManager = getContext().getCollection();              collectionManager.createDocument(                  collectionManager.getSelfLink(),                  docToCreate,                  function(err, docCreated) {                  if(err) throw new Error('Error:  ' + err.message);                  docCreated[addedPropertyName] = addedPropertyValue;                  getContext().getResponse().setBody(docCreated);                  });          }  }  ```  Notice the stored procedure is registered by executing a POST request against the URI dbs/testdb/colls/testColl/sprocs with the body containing the stored procedure to create. Triggers and UDFs can be registered similarly by issuing a POST against /triggers and /udfs respectively.     Once registered this stored procedure can then be executed by issuing a POST request against its resource link:  ```  POST https://<url>/sprocs/<sproc> HTTP/1.1  authorization: <<auth>>  x-ms-date: Thu, 07 Aug 2014 03:43:20 GMT      [ { ""name"": ""TestDocument"", ""book"": ""Autumn of the Patriarch""}, ""Price"", 200 ]  ```  Here, the input to the stored procedure is passed in the request body. Note that the input is passed as a JSON array of input parameters. The stored procedure takes the first input as a document that is a response body. The response we receive is as follows:  ```  HTTP/1.1 200 OK    {     name: 'TestDocument',    book: ‘Autumn of the Patriarch’,    id: ‘V7tQANV3rAkDAAAAAAAAAA==‘,    ts: 1407830727,    self: ‘dbs/V7tQAA==/colls/V7tQANV3rAk=/docs/V7tQANV3rAkDAAAAAAAAAA==/’,    etag: ‘6c006596-0000-0000-0000-53e9cac70000’,    attachments: ‘attachments/’,    Price: 200  }  ```    ## What needs to be done to enable this feature    ### F# ""shim types"" to support writing scripts  The DocumentDB scripting environment exposes a Context and a number of other types for doing things like setting response, reading parameters etc. Even the simple HelloWorld stored procedure below needs access to the Response type to set the response.    ```  POST https://dbs/testdb/colls/testColl/sprocs/sprocs/ HTTP/1.1  authorization: <<auth>>  x-ms-date: Thu, 07 Aug 2014 03:43:10 GMT    var x = {  ""name"": ""helloWorldStoredProc"",  ""body"": function () {          var context = getContext();          var response = context.getResponse();            response.setBody(""Hello, World"");          }  }  ```    These would be be something like:  ```  // shim types  type Request = {      content : string  }  type Response = {      body : string  } with      member this.setBody output =           this.body = output    type Context = {      request : Request      response : Response  } with       member this.getRequest =          this.request      member this.getResponse =          this.response    let getContext = {      request = {content = """"}      response = {body = """"}  }  ```  These types will let us write the stored procedure as:  ```  let helloWorldStoredProc =       let context = getContext      let response = context.getResponse      response.setBody ""Hello World""  ```  A full list of these types is [here]( http://azure.github.io/azure-documentdb-js-server/).     ### Post packaging  Because DocumentDB scripts can't reference any external libraries the JavaScrip Fable generates needst to be embedded into the function that will be registered with DocumentDB. Something like this:  ```  var helloWorldStoredProc = {      id: ""helloWorld"",      serverScript: function () {          <All the JS functions created to support f# features used          ...>            var context = getContext();          var response = context.getResponse();            response.setBody(""Hello, World"");      }  }  ```  This can then be posted to the desired URI to register the stored procedure.    ### Workflow  It is not clear what the best workflow for creating stored procedures will be.

__label__enhancement "[Suggestion] Compactor + Blaze/Blitz/Basalz/Blizz Pretty self explanatory, I was compacting 5 Blaze powder into a rod via IC2 today and thought to myself that it would be really cool if I could use TE to do that, as I've never really gotten into IC2 at all (no where near as pretty, fun or well engineered ;) ).    IMO 4 powder into a rod might be too powerful with the secondary outputs from pulverizing, meaning 5 could also be well balanced for TE. If you've ever thought about using the other rods for any recipes, I think it would be super handy to be able to make them this way.    ---    Completely separate suggestion, but following on from that idea, I'd also LOVE it if there could be blocks of the rods, so 9 rods into a block like a Blaze lantern. I think it would be great for decoration, maybe even have them emit light. Alternatively, I'd also suggest that you could even bring back the Glowstone Illuminator, with various TE fluids enabling different colours and the rods enabling different coloured frames! If you wanted to add some steps for balance or to increase the cost of entry, I'd suggest transposing Energised Glowstone into various solids (Enderium blend, Redstone, Blizz powder etc.) to generate glowing variants of items, to then put into rod frames to create the lantern. That's a whole completely different suggestion in-of-itself though, lmk if I should put it through as a separate thread if that's easier.    ---    Thanks for reading, and for all of your hard work, I couldn't bring myself to get into 1.12 until TE was all updated!"

__label__enhancement "Ghost-Effect Material: Simply using Rim and Refraction to get an eerie invisible-glow effect. Also, suggestions for enhancing the Rim options. **Operating system or device - Godot version:**    Godot 3.0 Pre-Alpha Build, Windows 10    Lately I've been messing around with the Spatial material to try to create a invisible/phantom/glowing membrane like material and was able to make this:    ![godot_ghost_effect](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5027750/27992575-b6509826-644c-11e7-8675-acbf477bc8c9.png)    Utilizing Rim to get the glowing edges and Refraction for the invisible distortion, this was the most impressive (or probably a not-bad, first time attempt) in recreating the effect. For Rim it turns out that despite the ""Tint"" adjustment goes up to 1 in maximum, there is no limit to how low the minimum is required. For example: adjust Tint to -100 and you have a blended glowing edge on your object!    Refraction is simple enough to utilize to get the invisble effect.    The idea and main point in this is that the Rim has the potential to be enhanced further so then it can be utilized in maybe creative ways. For example, ghosts or creepy, invisible membrane like object (Sorta like how Metroids have a near invisisble but glowing membrane)    What extras Rim should/could have:    - Make the Rim colorable, so then it does not use the same white glow,  - An adjustment bar or boolean for the rim glow to be ""emittable"", (Turns out you need a light source or directional light to get the glow, would be awesome if the rim was made emittable without a light source. Better if using an adjustment bar for animation or programming purposes.)  - Make an adjustment bar to adjust the width or visibility of the glowing rim so then typing -100 into the ""tint"" isn't used.  - And allow a boolean option whether different objects with rims appear behind the other invisble/rim objects (As you can see in the example image, the rims does not overlap or merge completely within another object.)    **Steps to reproduce:**    Add a new mesh to the scene, make a new material:    -Add a directional light to get the Rim glow.  -Adjust the Albedo's Alpha adjustment bar so then refraction can work,  -Set the Metallic to 0 and the Metallic Specular to 0 to avoid glassy reflections in refraction,  -Set Roughness to 0  -Enable Rim, set rim to ""1"", and type in the tint adjustment: ""-100"", trust me it works despite breaking limitations. (P.S. Unless there is an option to adjust the with of the rim, don't patch it.)  -Enable Refraction, set scale to 0.07. This allows distortion in invisibility  -(OPTIONAL): You can try to use Normalmapping to add details.

__label__enhancement "Spotters: Lifters that help other lifters when they fail (using Gymrat) This is a tracking issue for the effort to implement ""Spotters"" -- lifters that fix-up or implement missing features in other lifters.    The primary goal of this in the short term is to add hot-patches to libVEX using the gymrat framework, as we expect this to be 100000x easier than modding VEX itself.  For example, let's say we want to implement `svc` in ARM Cortex M; I don't expect the VEX folks to ever want to do that.  So we'll do it! But modding libVEX is complex, and I don't want to write a full gymrat lifter for ARM.  A Spotter here would be perfect.     Some scratch ideas:  - Lifters in pyvex are registered in ""order"", and tried in order, and if they fail, keep trying them  - rhelmot says we should be able to get partial blocks from VEX. This is the crucial trick.    Tasks:  1. Merge `feature/expanded_reality` into master so gymrat actually works  2. Mod the primary lifter mechanism so that partial block info is available to future lifters  3. Create a `Spotter` class (in lifter_helper.py) appropriate for these sorts of lifters.  4. Success criteria: We can do Cortex M4 hard FPU and maybe SVC, etc instructions this way.  "

__label__enhancement "Don't set max execution delay on JobScheduler when RequirementsEnforced is true Currently when you set RequirementsEnforced to true, the library still sets a max execution delay in JobScheduler when using  either JobScheduler or the Firebase JobScheduler.  It then checks that the requirements are meet, and reschedules with a back off period.  The client code still doesn't run, so the max window didn't do anything but cause the app to get woken up, so you can determine that it needs to wait longer.  This also seemed to cause a long delay before waking up when if the job had to be rescheduled many times.     Both of those JobSchedulers already have a way to make sure the job does not get started until the requirements are meet.  This library should instead add the requirements to the Job submitted to the JobSchedulers without a max delay, then the app is not woken up until the requirements are meet, and the delay between the job running and the requirements getting meet becomes very small.    I know this will not work for the alarm manager version.  This is where the waking up and checking for the conditions are required.    This will also keep the exponential back off to only apply to the job failing vs the requirements not getting meet.    If the user doesn't set RequirementsEnforced to true, then they want to get woken up if not able to complete, and then handle it some other way, and the current implementation makes sense.  "

__label__enhancement "Support for emitting the same state of an ECO button I just added an ECO button to my setup and I noticed that when it is ""open"" and I press ""auto"" (which will set the state to ""open"") this signal is not emitted again. This is due to the nature of pimatic ContactSensors (see pimatic/lib/devices.coffee line 511).    For me it would make sense that the ECO button emits it's state when pushed regardless of the previous state. Imagine you have two rules:  1) Press ""AUTO"" to set all thermostats to 20°  2) Press ""ECO"" to set all thermostats to 16°    This would work if you only use the button. But when you activated ECO mode and then changed the temperature of a thermostat by hand and just want to set all thermostats to ECO again this would not work as the button already is in ECO-state (""closed"") and will not emit the state again.    Is there any chance to change this behaviour? Perhaps this is also a request which has to be forwarded to pimatic itself."

__label__enhancement "Tournament mode This is winning the poll so after some discussion here's what I'm thinking for the first version of this:    Effectively a tournament is games played back to back by the same players until one (or more, most likely) wins the tournament by winning 2-5 games whatever it was set to.    In the Creategame view there will now be the following:    Tournament checkbox.  When checked, the following elements appear:    Wins to win tournament dropdown of numbers, 2-5, 2 default.    Blind mode checkbox default off.  Blind mode enabled means that all players names are deleted/blank when the tournament starts and cardbacks blank.    No reveal mode checkbox default off.  This mode means that when a game ends (that is not the deciding game), players roles are not revealed publicly.    A new modal will appear for anyone attempting to get seated at a tournament that says ""this is a tournament and will require a larger time commitment, are you sure you want to play multiple games?"" with confirm/cancel buttons.    Tournaments will only be available to players with 10+ completed games.    Winning a tournament results in:  larger/denser confetti, and a new ""crown"" icon next to the player's name for the next 4(?) hours.  Maybe next 10 games instead?  Multiple crowns can be accumulated.  Details hashed out later.   A third tier of playerlist will be implemented, not winrate but count of won tournaments.    Thoughts on the above welcomed, thanks.  This isn't all that hard. "

__label__enhancement "Make `@JsonView` annotation an alias of `@ResponseContentType(H.Media.JSON)` It is very common now a days to dictate an action handler or all action handlers of a a controller class to produce `application/json` type response without regarding to request's `Accept` header.    ActFramework has an annotation `act.cli.JsonView` to specify command method output to be displayed in JSON format. This request is to overload the function of `act.cli.JsonView` so that it can be used on an action handler method or controller class and get the same effect of `@ResponseContentType(H.Media.JSON)`. Say the following code:    ```java  @GetAction(""/order/{order}"")  @JsonView  public Order getOrder(@DbBind Order order) {     return order;  }  ```    should be exactly the same as    ```java  @GetAction(""/order/{order}"")  @ResponseContentType(H.Media.JSON)  public Order getOrder(@DbBind Order order) {     return order;  }  ```    **special note** since `@JsonView` annotation can be used to mark action handler, it is not suitable to keep it inside `act.cli`. We will deprecate `act.cli.JsonView` and create an new `JsonView` annotation inside `act.util` package to replace it. Any code marked with old `act.cli.JsonView` will not effect on action handler. Code marked with `act.util.JsonView` has effect of both command method and action handler method.    **special note2** When both `@JsonView` and `@ResponseContentType` used on action handler method, the `@ResponseContentType` takes priority.

The descriptor set associated with this array is updated very infrequently (not every frame).      Turning this rendering path on has caused a massive drop in performance with validation (< 1FPS) in DOTA.  The costs look spread out from profiling, but it basically is from iterating over the entire array in the cases where it validates descriptors.      I can't quite share a test case yet, but I'm wondering if we could disable validation somehow for large arrays of textures?  Another option might be detecting that the descriptor set is unchanged since previous use and skipping redundant validation?    "

__label__enhancement "Ability to choose which field to perform query with First of all: Fantastic job on the add-on! I could see this coming in handy for a variety of use cases and with all kinds of subjects.    One addition which I think the add-on could really benefit from, is a config option to set which field to look up. In most cases looking at the first field should be sufficient, but with some note types that might not be helpful. Take the Note ID add-on for instance: It uses a note type where the first field is always set to the NID. Needless to say, querying the web for the NID is not going to yield any relevant results.    If you could define which field to use, ideally on a per-note-type basis, that would really help.    Either way, thanks again for all the work you've put into this add-on! Very much looking forward to using this more extensively in the future."

__label__enhancement "Expose MessageHandlerMethodFactory as a bean As described in [INT-4363](https://jira.spring.io/browse/INT-4363) both frameworks (SI and SCSt) create an instance of _MessageHandlerMethodFactory_ resulting in _InvocableHandleMethod_ instances created with different set of `argumentResolvers` which essentially leads to a possibility of different results simply based on how operation is annotated (e.g., `@ServiceActivator(inputChannel=""input""` or `@StreamListener(""input"")`). I am currently tracking few cases where it is true.    Allowing `MessageHandlerMethodFactory` to be a shared infrastructure bean would bring consistency to the above use case while also giving SCSt certain level of control for cases where SI configuration is not in play (i.e., Streaming binders such as KStream, DStream etc). In other words if such bean is declared as `@ConditionalOnMissingBean` in parent configuration the underlying framework such as SCSt could determine if it can reuse the same instance or override one with its own resulting in consistent set of _InvocableHandleMethod_ and `argumentResolvers` across all data handling operations.

I understand that you can simply scroll up to keep the chat from moving but sometimes it doesn't suffice as a message may be the most recent one so scrolling up would simply hide the one you potentially might be targeting.    2. A setting to increase the amount of lines that are saved in the chat pane; again, similar to what BTTV has.    3. Perhaps a chat logging feature; clicking the downwards arrow and then have a checkbox which enables chat logging where all messages are saved to a text file"

However, i think it makes sense to also enable auto-start by checking if a jest.config.js file exists in the workspace.     We have a bit of a non-traditional setup, but basically, our node_modules are shared between multiple projects, so we don't necessarily want individual node_modules folders in each project directory, but if moving the config out of the shared package.json to individual jest.config.js files would enable this extension to run on project-open, i'd happily do that.    ### Proposed Solution  add...    ```workspaceContains:jest.config.js```    ...to the `activationEvents` array in `package.json`"

__label__enhancement "Define SONAME, based on 'ABI version number', in C++ libraries It would be useful to define the ""soname"" field in uHAL's C++ libraries, based on an version number for the libraries' ABIs.    In particular, doing this would protect against confusion when a uHAL-based library/application is compiled against one version of uHAL, but then continues to be used after a newer version of uHAL with a different ABI has been installed. With the soname field defined, the application will fail to load the uHAL libraries after a new version of uHAL with different ABI has been installed, and the user will be forced to recompile their application; whereas, without the soname defined, instead the application would load the new version of the library, and the user might only realise that the dependent library/application needs to be recompiled after strange runtime errors (undefined behaviour) occur.    So far, the uHAL ABI has remained constant for all patch releases within any given minor release - i.e. versions X.Y.Z and X.Y.Z+1 of a uHAL library have the same ABI, but versions X.Y.Z and X.Y+1.0 may have different ABI. Therefore, the uHAL library SONAMEs will be of the form`libSomeName.so.majorVersion.minorVersion` (e.g. `libcactus_uhal_uhal.so.2.5`).    Following standard convention in other aspects, the library file name will be:  ```  libSomeName.so.<major>.<minor>.<patch>  ```  and the following symbolic links will be created:  ```  libSomeName.so.<major>.<minor>  -->  libSomeName.so.<major>.<minor>.<patch>  libSomeName.so   -->  libSomeName.so.<major>.<minor>  ```"

Here are a few examples illustrating how the metrics could be refactored to use tagging:    * `consul.catalog.service.query.<ServiceName>` -> `consul.catalog.service.query`, `<service:ServiceName>`  * `serf.queries.<QueryName>` -> `serf.queries`, `<query:QueryName>`    This sort of functionality is also needed for proper Prometheus integration, as discussed in #817."

Unfortunately, it doesn't work the way I expected it to.    I thought the entire point of the copy-constructor is to enable users to inherit configuration from an existing pool, then override some parameters, then launch the pool. Maybe this used to work in a past release, but it no longer does.    The copy-constructor is launching the new pool immediately. This means that any configuration changes requested after the copy constructor is invoked are being ignored silently.    Expected behavior:    1. Users should be able to reconfigure the pool after invoking the copy-constructor, before pulling the first Connection.  2. Configuration methods (e.g. `setJdbcUrl()`) should throw `IllegalStateException` if the pool is already started instead of ignoring such calls silently."

__label__enhancement "Include binary-only dependencies in Rome cache #### Enhancement Suggestion    Make Rome take `binary` dependencies into account from `Cartfile`.    **Steps which explain the enhancement**    1. Check for `binary` dependencies in `Cartfile` / `Cartfile.resolved`.  2. Take those into account so that they are included in the local Rome cache (so that the network download can be avoided if already cached locally).    **Current and suggested behavior**    It appears that currently Rome does not take binary-only Carthage dependencies into account.  For projects like ours that depend on large, externally-hosted binaries, this means we have to add an extra step that does `carthage bootstrap <binarydeps>` to ensure those dependencies are available in the `Carthage/Binaries` directory, which means always making a network request.  (Even on a fast connection this might add 10-30 seconds to a build, whereas if the local cache could be used it would be < 1 second.)    **Why would the enhancement be useful to most users**    For any users relying on binary-only dependencies, it would no longer be necessary to add special workarounds, and builds would be faster by taking advantage of locally cached binaries instead of making network requests.    **Rome version:** 0.13.0.33  **OS and version:** macOS 10.12.6  "

For error signals, on the other hand, there is currently no way, that I could find, to do something simple using the current context on error signals.    It may not make sense to have a context-aware version of all onX methods, but by having a `doOnEach` version that receives the current context at least these use case could be achieved easily.    Currently, need to do something like this:    ```  .transform(doOnNextOrErrorWithContext(context -> context.getOrEmpty(TCCL_REACTOR_CTX_KEY).ifPresent(cl -> currentThread().setContextClassLoader((ClassLoader) cl))))  .transform(next)  .transform(doOnNextOrErrorWithContext(context -> context.getOrEmpty(TCCL_ORIGINAL_REACTOR_CTX_KEY).ifPresent(cl -> currentThread().setContextClassLoader((ClassLoader) cl)))));        private Function<? super Publisher<CoreEvent>, ? extends Publisher<CoreEvent>> doOnNextOrErrorWithContext(Consumer<Context> contextConsumer) {      return lift((scannable, subscriber) -> new CoreSubscriber<CoreEvent>() {          private Context context = subscriber.currentContext();          @Override        public void onNext(CoreEvent event) {          contextConsumer.accept(context);          subscriber.onNext(event);        }        @Override        public void onError(Throwable throwable) {          contextConsumer.accept(context);          subscriber.onError(throwable);        }          @Override        public void onComplete() {          subscriber.onComplete();        }          @Override        public Context currentContext() {          return context;        }          @Override        public void onSubscribe(Subscription s) {          subscriber.onSubscribe(s);        }      });    }  ```    But should really be able to do something like this:  ```  .doOnEachWithContext((s, context) -> {      context.getOrEmpty(TCCL_REACTOR_CTX_KEY).ifPresent(cl -> currentThread().setContextClassLoader((ClassLoader) cl))))  }  .transform(next)  .doOnEachWithContext((s, context) -> {      context.getOrEmpty(TCCL_REACTOR_CTX_KEY).ifPresent(cl -> currentThread().setContextClassLoader((ClassLoader) cl))))  }  ```    "

Since `ApInt` is similar to a `Vec<u64` we can employ a similar strategy to actually implement `Hash`.  `Vec` did it by deref into a `slice` over its elements and then simply uses the `Hash` implementation of the fundamental `slice` type as can be seen [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/src/alloc/vec.rs.html#1536).    While doing this it might be useful to also implement `Hash` for other types in the public interface.

__label__enhancement "Add option to pass in existing builder. Currently, a new ContainerBuilder is created by the AutofacServiceProviderFactory.    I have a situation in which i want to pass in an existing builder. I have a Windows Service running using TopSelf. The topshelf application hosts various things (2 WCF services) and I also want to host a WebApi from the service. The service itself is already configured using Autofac and I want the WebApi to use the same container.    I achieve running the WebApi by registering:    ```  builder.Register(c =>              {                  return WebHost.CreateDefaultBuilder()                     .ConfigureServices(s => s.AddAutofac())                     .UseHttpSys()                     .UseSerilog(c.Resolve<ILogger>())                     .UseStartup<Startup>()                     .Build();              })              .As<IWebHost>()              .SingleInstance();  ```    and then in my main class resolving an `IWebHost` and calling `Start()`. This all works. However, the `s.AddAutofac()` method creates a new `AutofacServiceProviderFactory` which creates a new `ContainerBuilder`. I would like something along the lines of:    ```  builder.Register(c =>              {                  return WebHost.CreateDefaultBuilder()                     .ConfigureServices(s => s.AddAutofac(builder))                     .UseHttpSys()                     .UseSerilog(c.Resolve<ILogger>())                     .UseStartup<Startup>()                     .Build();              })              .As<IWebHost>()              .SingleInstance();  ```"
__label__enhancement "Inconsistent handling of unchecked exception This is not a big issue, but the exception handling is a bit confusing.    In a lot of the low-level logic there are methods declaring unchecked exceptions. For example in _ValueIn_:        @Nullable      Object marshallable(Object object, SerializationStrategy strategy)              throws **BufferUnderflowException**, **IORuntimeException**;    However, these unchecked exceptions are not propagated consistently in method signatures of higher-level logic.    From this mix of declared and undeclared unchecked exceptions it's very hard to figure out what to expect. Not propagating the exceptions makes it look like they have been handled. However, this is not usually the case.    I guess the easiest improvement would be to **add catch clauses** to the Chronicle Queue code examples (in the Chronicle-Queue project).     But for the Chronicle-Wire project, it would be nice to add some documentation around the API. For example, is there a specific set of API calls where we can expect unchecked exceptions (e.g. due to corrupt data)? Also, some general documentation around exception throwing strategy (i.e. letting the user take care of any exceptions) would be much appreciated.    Thanks for making great software!      _Scenario where it's difficult to understand what to expect_    Let's say we do the following (using Chronicle-Queue):                try (DocumentContext dc = tailer.readingDocument()) {                  if (dc.isPresent()) {                      ValueIn valueIn = dc.wire().getValueIn();                      next = valueIn.object();              }    In this case we might get a RuntimeException thrown (e.g. if data is corrupt) by the call to valueIn.object() -- which does not declare any exceptions in it's signature.    For example:    Caught throwable: net.openhft.chronicle.core.io.IORuntimeException: Unknown_0x0  	at net.openhft.chronicle.wire.BinaryWire$BinaryValueIn.bool(BinaryWire.java:2975)  	at net.openhft.chronicle.wire.WireMarshaller$BooleanFieldAccess.setValue(WireMarshaller.java:752)  	at net.openhft.chronicle.wire.WireMarshaller$FieldAccess.read(WireMarshaller.java:313)  	at net.openhft.chronicle.wire.WireMarshaller.readMarshallable(WireMarshaller.java:143)  	at net.openhft.chronicle.wire.Wires.readMarshallable(Wires.java:253)  	at net.openhft.chronicle.wire.SerializationStrategies$5.readUsing(SerializationStrategies.java:121)  	at net.openhft.chronicle.wire.BinaryWire$BinaryValueIn.marshallable(BinaryWire.java:2897)  	at net.openhft.chronicle.wire.ValueIn.object(ValueIn.java:482)  	at net.openhft.chronicle.wire.BinaryWire$BinaryValueIn.objectWithInferredType(BinaryWire.java:3158)  	at net.openhft.chronicle.wire.ValueIn.object(ValueIn.java:435)    Using version 4.5.27, but as far as I can see it's the same thing in master."

In a non-git and clean git directories the right prompt does not print anything.  To use the standard __fish_git_prompt.fish function for the right prompt, I modified it to add a variable __fish_git_prompt_hidebranch. To use this function effectively, it needs to be possible to individually turn off all elements in the output. There might be other ones, but this variable solved my problem.  ``` diff ~/.config/fish/functions/__fish_git_prompt.fish /usr/local/Cellar/fish/2.1.0/share/fish/functions/__fish_git_prompt.fish  171,176d170 < # Added by Heikki Lehvaslaiho <heikki.lehvaslaiho@gmail.com> < # < # Turn on variable __fish_git_prompt_hidebranch not to display branch < # name.

__label__enhancement "Extend the dataset joining options: When validating data against a reference dataset , it is often necessary to define how the two datasets should be joined. The ""validate"" package recognises this by introducing the optional ""key"" parameter in the confront operator, which basically states on which field the two datasets would need to be joined. For aggregate data, this functionality should be extended to allow the key to be a list of fields (although you might end up with the disadvantage of having a very long key, which would make the rules harder to read). It may also be useful to introduce different possible join options. Right now, it seems to me that, by default, the use of the ""key"" parameter results in a left join. Other types of join may be interesting. [suggested by Luca Gramaglia] "

__label__enhancement "Incompatibility with pandoc-crossref I found a pretty good solution to the problem referencing figures, tabels, equations etc (see #567). through the pandoc filter [pandoc-crossref](https://github.com/lierdakil/pandoc-crossref/blob/master/docs/man.md). Of course, this is only a fix for the PDF that gets produced by running `pandoc` command, and support in Caret with live preview of cross reference links etc. would be ideal.    Unfortunately the syntax of pandoc-crossref make Caret not render live previews. For example an image with a label in pandoc-crossref syntax is `![Caption](url){fig:labelhere}`. But adding the curly brackets at the end, breaks the live preview of the figure in Caret. So `pandoc-crossref` is quite unusable with Caret now.    I'm using Typora as well, and it doesn't have this problem; adding `{fag:label}` at the end, still renders the image preview (Typora gives me other headaches such as not showing the alt-text / captions with the image preview, but that's another topic).    I hope you will consider some kind of solution for this. Perhaps allowing {} tags with figures, tables, equation etc. without breaking the live preview?"

__label__enhancement "Add interactivity ""buffer"" around vector features We started to work on something like this while I was at NPS but never finished our solution. Basically, the problem is that some vector features overlaid on the map are difficult to interact with because the clickable radius around, say, a line often isn't large enough. This issue is especially noticeable on mobile devices.    One obvious solution is to bump up the width of a line. This isn't always ideal, though, because this means the line's width has to get bumped up as well. We should think about this and either:    1.
